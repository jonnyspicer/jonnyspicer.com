This is the source code for my personal site, hosted at [https://jonnyspicer.com](https://jonnyspicer.com) and built with Hugo. The repo also contains some miscellaneous Python scripts; the ```new``` and ```publish``` scripts allow me
to write and post blogs easily, the ```alias``` script is for modifying the
content of all posts at once, and the ```wordcount``` script is run during the
build process on AWS Amplify, dynamically updating the homepage.

In the future I plan to tidy up the scripts and house them in a separate repo, and create a
Hugo theme based on the code I currently have. You're free to use the code in this project
providing you do so in accordance with its license, and please [reach out to me](https://jonnyspicer.com/contact/) if you have any
questions, comments, requests etc.
