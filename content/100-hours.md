There are 8766 hours in a year, and I want to use them efficiently in order to get healthier and happier. To that end I came up with six
activities that I wanted to spend at least 100 hours doing in 2022, which you can read more about [here.](/blog/2022-goals) This page
is for tracking how much of each activity I've done, and whether or not I'm on track for my goals this year.
