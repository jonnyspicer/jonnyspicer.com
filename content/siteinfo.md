You might notice some things about this site, for example that there's no cookie popup. That's because there are no cookies served with this site, it has no analytics function.

There's also very few animations, and almost no JavaScript - in fact most pages ship with less than 1kB of it. I think sites should be accessible first, performant second, stylish
third, and collectors of information last. This site was built with those priorities in mind.

Originally this site was a 3rd party hosted Wordpress install, then a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and now it's a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site hosted on [AWS Amplify.](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) The theme is bespoke, but I'm not a frontend developer and it shows.

The source code for the site, as well as some simple scripts that I built in order to interact with it, are [available on GitHub.](https://github.com/jonnyspicer/jonnyspicer.com)
