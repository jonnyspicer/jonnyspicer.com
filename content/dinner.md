<h1 class="big-title">You're invited to dinner!</h1>

*Scroll down to RSVP via Calendly.*

## What
Dinner, with myself (Jonny) and my partner, JBC herself. Everything will be vegetarian, and there will be at least one vegan option. We'll provide the food, but please BYOB as we're not big drinkers ourselves. 

We're also going to try and play [People Bingo](https://twitter.com/RichardMCNgo/status/1607975232484298752) (although probably not using the same squares as that link). When you arrive, you'll be handed a bingo sheet and a dabber of some kind. You'll have to interact with other people there in order to mark off squares - there will be a prize for the first person to get a verified bingo!

## Who
You! If you're reading this, it's presumably because you found the link as part of the WhatsApp group, in which case, you and yours are invited.

If you somehow found this page without being part of the group, feel free to [contact me](/contact) and I'll probably let you come too.

## Where

At our flat in Haggerston, a couple of minutes walk from the overground stop. The exact address is in the description of the WhatsApp group.

## When

Saturday 29th April, between 6pm - 11pm. After 11pm I'll be tired and probably a lot less fun to be around.

## Why

Partially because I have friends that do it and their dinners are fun, partially because of [this blog post about how to live near your friends,](https://prigoose.substack.com/p/how-to-live-near-your-friends) and partially because I'm too busy to spend as much time with all my friends as I'd like.
