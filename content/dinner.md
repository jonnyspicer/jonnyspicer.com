<h1 class="big-title">You're invited to dinner!</h1>

*Scroll down to RSVP via Calendly.*

## What
It's my (30th) birthday! Julian, Emma and Seb have kindly offered to host dinner as I am ~homeless (relatedly, I am living out of a rucksack, so if you bring me a gift I will be polite and gracious about it at the time but might secretly resent you for it, I would much rather you gave to an effective charity etc etc). We'll provide the food, but please BYOB. 

## Who
You! Plus ones are welcome but please let me know ahead of time so I can make sure there's enough food for everyone.

## Where

At their flat in De Beauvoir, a few minutes walk from the Haggerston overground station. The exact address is in the description of the WhatsApp group.

## When

The 23rd November (regularly programming might resume when I have a home again). Come round from 7ish, we'll likely serve food around 8.

## Why

To celebrate the shear improbability of me having made it to 30 years old in one piece, and as a flimsy excuse to be the centre of attention for a night.

Also partially because I have friends that do it and their dinners are fun, partially because of [this blog post about how to live near your friends,](https://prigoose.substack.com/p/how-to-live-near-your-friends) and partially because I'm too busy to spend as much time with all my friends as I'd like.

To RSVP: select the next date with a blue circle around it, then pick 7:00pm (it's fine if you come later than that), click "Confirm", fill in your details and then click "Schedule Event". You might have to go to the next month for a date to be available, or there might not be one set up - if that's the case message me and gently nudge me to set the next date.
