*Last updated: 17th February 2026*

I was born and raised on the beautiful island of Guernsey (part of which is pictured below), and lived there the majority of my life before moving to London in 2021. My career path thus far has had some thrills
and spills, the most exciting of which was playing poker full time in 2017. These days I work as a [software and AI consultant](https://allinlabs.io) and I am actively exploring founding a [precision psychiatry](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/precision-psychiatry-predicting-predictability/7A51DBDF832F47502DE677D0FE0A9BE6) project. I have [pledged to donate at least 10% of my salary to effective charities for the rest of my career](/blog/giving-what-i-can/).

I spend a lot of my free time running and have [completed several ultramarathons](https://utmb.world/runner/4217931.jonny.spicer). Previously I have been a competitive sabre fencer, chess player, public speaker and powerlifter. I have been most influenced by [Scott Alexander](https://www.astralcodexten.com/), [David Foster Wallace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace), [Sean "Day[9]" Plott](https://day9.tv/), [Nick Cammarata](https://x.com/nickcammarata), [Howie Lempel](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/depression-anxiety-imposter-syndrome/), [Joey Ingram](https://www.youtube.com/user/joeingram1/videos), [the Stoics](https://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.html), [Car Seat Headrest](https://www.carseatheadrest.com/), [RRR](/blog/brother-teach-me/), [@european.son.420](https://www.instagram.com/european.son.420/), [my ex-housemate](https://earlyaccess.myathletics.uk/Home/Athlete/ae14f74a-3c95-4f72-88db-2053626a76e4), [my running coach](https://centurioncoaching.co.uk/coaches/sophie-grant), [my best friend](https://www.sylvera.com/authors/polly-thompson) and [my brother](https://schoolofpopularmusic.com/team-member/charlie-spicer/). 

I've struggled over the years with issues to do with weight, body image, self-esteem, anxiety and depression, all of which are now things I try to be an advocate for speaking openly
and honestly about. To that end, they're also the most prevalent themes in my [blog](/blog), which I write in regularly.
