I was born and raised on the beautiful island of Guernsey (part of which is pictured below), and have lived here the majority of my life. My career path thus far has had some thrills
and spills, the most exciting of which was playing poker full time in 2017. Since then I've finally managed to channel the endless hours I've spent at a computer during my lifetime
into something positive, which is going surprisingly well as I'm currently a software engineer at [Zoopla](https://zoopla.co.uk).

I play chess, enjoy climbing and running, and I'm trying really hard to be one of those people that reads a lot of books so I can seem smart when I go on dates. Fortunately, I never
go on any dates.

At the moment I am primarily working with Golang and the AWS Serverless stack, but I also have experience with C#, JavaScript, Python and HTML/CSS. I'm completely self-taught and have
always found the best way for me to learn a language or a technology has been to get stuck in and build something, even if it sucks. Which it always does, to start.

I've struggled over the years with issues to do with weight, body image, self esteem, anxiety and depression, all of which are now things I try to be an advocate for speaking openly
and honestly about. To that end, they're also the most prevalent themes in my [blog](/blog), which I write in regularly.
