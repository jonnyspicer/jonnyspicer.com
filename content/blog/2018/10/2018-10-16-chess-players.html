  Chess players are infuriating. Trying to organise them is like trying to
  herd cats. Trying to converse with them is like trying to draw blood from a
  stone. For a bunch of people capable of playing an immensely complex and
  nuanced game to a high level, they are almost universally idiots.

  I am absolutely one of said idiots.
