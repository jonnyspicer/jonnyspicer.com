title: Nothing is real anymore
---

<span >Today I learned some more about how convolutional neural networks can be trained to alter videos, such that one person's face can appear in place of another. By "learned about", I mean "watched some YouTube videos about", but still. It's pretty scary - a bunch of people have started using it to put celebrity's faces in porn videos, which obviously sucks, but there are a lot of other scary things. Fake videos could be used to blackmail people, video evidence could be faked in court, a million other things. People's reputations could be decimated on a massive scale by this technology, and it'll be widely accessible very soon - in one form it already is. I am pretty sure I could get it to work myself. Nothing is real anymore.&nbsp;</span>
