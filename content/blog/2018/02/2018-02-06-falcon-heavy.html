title: Falcon Heavy
---

<span >Today I was worried I would struggle to type something positive today, but then I watched the Falcon Heavy test launch.What an incredible thing to witness, science fiction brought to life. It's difficult to even find words to describe how awe-inspiring it was, combined with the continuous cheering from the team behind the project, made it feel like something very special. My faith in humanity went up a little this evening.</span>
