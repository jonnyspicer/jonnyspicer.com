<span >It's so amazing to progress at something I find joy in. After learning a few songs by McCafferty and The Front Bottoms I can see what makes their sound and their riffs, and play something similar of my own creation. Now all I need is some whiny self-absorbed lyrics and I could start a band.</span><br /><br />
