title: Switching off
---

<span >This week I have got into the habit of switching my phone off for almost all of the day, only switching it on again in the evening so I can set an alarm on it. It is amazing to not check it every 5 minutes, no buzzing, if I don't want to be contacted then I can easily not be. 10/10 would strongly recommend.</span>
