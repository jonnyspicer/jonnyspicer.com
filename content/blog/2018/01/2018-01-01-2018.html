<span >Well, I made it to 2018, just about. Last night I was so drunk I ate an entire lemon, peel and everything. It felt like a fitting end to the year. An older lady told me she was a therapist, so I started telling her about my problems - at which point it turns out I had misheard, and she was in fact a <i>beauty therapist. </i>Fuck my life. At least she gave me so good tips for my nails.</span>
