<p>
  I'm far too busy - too busy to think of a meaningful topic for today's blog.
  Too busy to relax or to slow down, too much to do - why do I do this to myself?
  I don't have time to answer the question, or else I'll be late for chess club.
  Chess will run later than my bed time too, so I'm even too busy to sleep. Fuck!
