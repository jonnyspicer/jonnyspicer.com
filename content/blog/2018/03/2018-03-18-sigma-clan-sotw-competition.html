title: Sigma Clan SOTW Competition
---

<span >In just under 3 hours, the Sigma Clan Skill of the Week competition starts, and this week it is a skill I am thoroughly ambivalent about, Runecrafting. I am going to be asleep for the start but gonna try really hard to nolife as much as possible and hopefully place at least top 5 for the week, maybe I can get close to 99 RC too?</span>
