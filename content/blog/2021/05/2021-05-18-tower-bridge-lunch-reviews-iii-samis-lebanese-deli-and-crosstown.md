Today I pushed the boat out and ordered from a real person, not once, but twice. Sami's Lebanese Deli is right round the corner from the office and always
has a queue out its door so is clearly a popular spot, and Crosstown's doughtnut vans showed up in pretty much every search I did for try-before-you-die food
in London, so both were obvious choices.

## Ordering experience
### Sami's Lebanese Deli
Sami's was nice and simple, the staff were super friendly and seemed happy I was in there to enjoy their food. The food was quick and I got to watch it be prepared right behind the
counter.
### Crosstown
The choice at Crosstown is a little overwhelming, especially given that ever single option looks incredible (and unlike choosing something savoury, my choice isn't narrowed down by
vegetarianism). The guy in the cart was plenty patient with me, and obviously the process of putting a doughnut in a bag is a hard one to go wrong.

## Food
### Sami's Lebanese Deli
The falafel wrap with all the trimmings I had was *delicious*. It was hefty but not greasy at all, and much like the burger from Leon yesterday, the vegetables involved tasted genuine
enough to lead me to believe they might have some kind of nutritional value. There is a falafel *and* halloumi wrap option that I only spotted after I'd ordered that I slightly regretted
not getting, but perhaps I'll try and stick to fully vegan options for all my reviews this week. 
### Crosstown
Crosstown appears to have quite the reputation preceding it, and when I bit into the peanut butter and blackcurrant compote doughnut I bought, I understood why. It was the best doughnut
I've ever had, and I'm not sure it's even particularly close. This was something *artisanal*, and I still ate it with my fingers and got jam round my mouth like an animal.

## Value for money
### Sami's Lebanese Deli
At £5.95, for the amount of food on offer, I think Sami's offers excellent value for money. I was pretty stuffed after the wrap and really didn't *need* the subsequent dessert, but hey,
when in Rome. For something hot, quick, filling and maybe even not totally awful for your health, Sami's is a winner at its pricepoint.
### Crosstown
Unsurprisingly, with something as high quality as a Crosstown doughnut, you are going to be paying a premium for it, and I paid £4.50 for my sweet and salty fix. Obviously it's a lot of
money, I could have got 20 doughtnuts from the nearby Tesco for the same price, *but* I still think it offers value as a rare treat.

## Overall
### Sami's Lebanese Deli
I will definitely be going back to Sami's, and probably quite regularly. Friendly staff, quick service, tasty and reasonably priced food impressed my hugely, especially given how much of
a rarity the latter appears to be in this city. 9/10
### Crosstown
Going to Crosstown regularly would be catastrophic for both my bank balance and my body fat percentage, but it's way too good for me to think I'm not going to be heading there for a monthly
sweet pick-me-up. On days when I feel a little low, or am celebrating a personal victory, I can definitely see myself wolfing down another one of London's worst-kept secrets.
