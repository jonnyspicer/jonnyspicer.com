Today was the first time I got to meet the majority of my team in person, and it was a wonderful experience. While I feel like we'd already collectively built
a strong rapport over Slack and video calls, the small talk afforded by being in the same room makes us feel a lot more like a *team*, which I love. Asking
and offering help suddenly had much less friction as I could easily see if somebody was engrossed or struggling, rather than having to reach out via message
and potentially disrupt them. It was nice to eat lunch with other people, and I'm sure going to the pub after work will be fun too - I am curious to see
what they're all like after they've let their (in cases metaphorical) hair down a little.

This step towards normality has meant a lot, and made me very happy. Hopefully there are many more to come.
