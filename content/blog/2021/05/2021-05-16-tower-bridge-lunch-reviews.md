While I said the other day my anxiety hasn't stopped me from doing too much, it has stopped me maximising my lunch options in the last week. When I'm in the office, there are a number of great
looking places around that I'd love to try, but when compared with the option of M&S self-checkout, the comfort of familiarity and desire to minimise human interaction always get the better of
me. As a way to both keep myself accountable for getting out of my comfort zone and milking another lazy premise for a whole week of blog posts, every day for the next five I'm going to try
somewhere new for lunch, and write a review of it. Hopefully after next week I'll have found my feet enough to get back to writing some slightly higher quality posts...
