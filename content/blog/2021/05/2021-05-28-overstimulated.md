There's a lot going on in London; sounds, sights, smells and of course an abundance of tastes. In my brief experience so far, it's an intense place to live.
I've also got back into the habit of picking up my phone every 5 minutes and scrolling on Instagram. I've eaten too much and not slept enough recently; all
of this has left me feeling thoroughly overstimulated, in a kind of wide-eyed daze as various things flash and beep that I am only dimly aware of. While
building back good habits is the mid-term fix, I am glad I have the shortcut of having a floating session booked in tomorrow. The complete stimulation
detox it offers is both brief and expensive, but ultimately more than worth it.
