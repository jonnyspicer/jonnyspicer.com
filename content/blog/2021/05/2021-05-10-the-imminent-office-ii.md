Today was my first day in the office, and it certainly lived up to expectations. The building
and the decor are stunning, far nicer than any office I've ever been in, certainly surpassing
the working conditions I had hoped for even in a "big, fancy London office". The location is
also unbelievable, Tower Bridge is all of 60 seconds away. Sitting by the river with a view of
the city was gorgeous, although admittedly I'm still not sure it beats sitting on Crown Pier
and looking out toward Herm.

The covid test I had to take upon entering was obviously not pleasant, and the fact that I have
to take one every day I go into the office certainly does not fill me with excitement, but I
don't have too much choice given I can't get broadband installed in my flat until May 24th
at the earliest. The office's size does lend it a certain labyrinthe quality, which is made
all the more mysterious by so many rooms and corridors being presently off-limits, and it's
going to take me quite a while to learn how to navigate the place. The air conditioning is also
intensely powerful, and I'm going to have to take extra clothes to wear while sat at my desk
in future.

The best part of the office is far and away that it means I get to work in a room with people
again, something which I've missed a great deal, and is doubly appreciated while I have so few
social contacts in London. To Zoopla's huge credit, they seem to hire great people (obviously
with the exception of yours truly, but everyone makes mistakes), and everyone I met was kind,
patient and welcoming. I think I'm going to be very happy working there - especially once
we take more steps towards normality.
