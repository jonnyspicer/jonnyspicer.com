On Sunday I went for a reasonably long run (~27.5km) and then proceed to have several pints of ale in the evening and about 4 hours sleep. This evening I
headed out on a 12km "social" group run and it was... not good. Obviously. I shouldn't have to have had the experience of it being bad to know that it was
going to be bad.

I have a couple of big races coming up alarmingly soon, and after the success of [Dry January,](/series/dry-january/) I've decided to bring back teetotalism
for the next "J" month of the year, and give Dry June a whirl, which will likely also bleed into Dry July as that's when the races are. After that, who knows?
Perhaps I'll give up alcohol forever.

I am very excited about the health and finance benefits offered by the prospect of not drinking. I am obviously worried my social life will suffer, especially
at a time when I am keen to make new friends and would love the conversational lubricant that alcohol affords, but I don't think drinking is worth it for me.
I guess I'll just have to learn how to actually have a conversation with a stranger while sober.
