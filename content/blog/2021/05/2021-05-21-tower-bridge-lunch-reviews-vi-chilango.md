For the last day of my week of trying new places, it was time for Chilango, a burrito
joint that I'd had my eye on from pretty much as soon as I got to London.

## Ordering experience
Chilango use the Subway model - ie you choose the base of your meal at the start and
then work your way down the line of extras while your server progressively builds
up your meal. I just said "yes" to everything which made the whole thing very easy.

## Food
This is actually the second burrito I've had in London, the first being from the
humbly named "Tortilla", and Chilango's offering was a significant improvement. It
was big, saucy, and the vegan fake chicken actually tasted great. My biggest
complaint though is definitely that the "hot" salsa was in fact incredibly
underwhelming, which is a shame because habanero salsa is my favourite thing about
Mexican cuisine.

## Value for money
The "this ain't chicken" burrito with all the trimmings set me back Â£10.45, which
is a lot! I would find it very hard to justify paying that price for it again,
unless perhaps I was very hungover.

## Overall
The food at Chilango's was nice, but it was simply too expensive for my apparently
frugal blood. Honestly, if the sauce had been hotter, maybe I'd have forgiven them
for the whole thing, but alas that's not the case, and I see myself turning
elsewhere to get my Mexican fix in future.
