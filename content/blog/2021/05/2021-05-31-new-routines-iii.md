A week on from [lamenting my lack of routine](/blog/new-routines-ii/) and progress has been made, but there's still a long way to go. My mornings are quite
sorted - I am really enjoying the ritual of making my own bean-to-cup coffee every day. My climbing days are Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, and
on the weekdays I always go at 8:30. My running schedule is still Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday, and now Tuesday is a club run and
Sunday is too, unless I'm taking a train to somewhere with hills for me to get some trail practice in. My bedtime routine still needs a lot of work - I have
found the time to read some of my book over the long weekend, which I have enjoyed a lot, and it feels like an important part of a healthy pre-sleep routine
for me, so I'm going to try to get it in on the weekdays too. Obviously I am still listening to ASMR to actually get to sleep, every single night. Eating is
a little all over the place - ideally I would like to get into the habit of taking lunch in to work with me every day, but so far I've mostly been going to
M&S, which is the "cheap" option compared to other nearby food outlets. In the evenings I have already had *far* too many takeaways, but I figure maybe that
was inevitable while I was getting settled in. I have a rice cooker on its way, and I think once that's here I put do a week of trying to cook a different
meal every night (or possibly a different variation on the same meal) and milk that for a whole week of posts, as a way to hold myself accountable to actually
cooking for myself. I have already set the fire alarm off twice while using the oven, which makes me pretty scared of doing so in the future.

Essentially the only pieces left in the puzzle are eating, reading and sleeping - the basics. I know that I need to focus on the basics to be happy, and so
that's what I'm going to do.
