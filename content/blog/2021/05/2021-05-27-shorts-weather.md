Today is the first time all year I've donned shorts for reasons other than exercise, and it was pretty lovely. After missing the sun dearly for months,
it was finally out in full force to warm my bare legs, and the prospect of being shut inside in my office for most of the day suddenly felt far less appealing
than it had previously.

I promise I'll write a more interesting blog post at the weekend... I'm just too busy at the moment. The sunshine is helping me feel good about that though.
