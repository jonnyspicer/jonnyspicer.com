Today was my first chance to head back to [Floatworks](https://floatworks.com) since November 2019, and I'd missed it dearly. Now I've moved to a city that overwhelms the senses, the appeal
of the deprivation tank has only been enhanced further, and I enjoyed my hour in the oasis of calm and quiet. I found it went by surprisingly quickly, perhaps illustrative of there being a lot
on my mind, although I found it easier than usual to keep still and simply think and breathe. I'm not sure I reached any entirely new conclusions during my time in the pod, but I certainly
strengthened my resolve on some things. It was good to be back floating.
