Today I had the pleasure of not eating lunch solo, and instead going out to eat with
my product manager, who suggested Omoide, a delightful sushi place just slightly
further away from Tower Bridge but still within comfortable walking distance.

## Ordering experience
Omoide's beauty is in its simplicity; there are only a handful of things on the menu.
An even smaller number of there were vegan, and in fact there was only one chirashi
bowl that ticked that box, making the choice easy. It was again prepared right in
front of me, so the whole process was quick and painless.

## Food
The "Farmers Market" bowl I had was delicious, and I enjoyed the variety of flavours
encompassed within the dish. It was all seemingly fairly healthy too, at least to
the extent that I felt no guilt in having eaten it afterwards; although by 5pm I
was rather hungry once again.

## Value for money
I paid Â£9.50 for something that was probably ~500kcal, which is a lot, especially
given I don't think it had a tonne of protein in either. Obviously I would expect
sushi/Japanese cuisine to be relatively expensive, but I would've hoped the veggie
option might be a bit more reasonably priced.

## Overall
The food was good, but not great, and the price was a little steep for me. Combined
with the extra walk, it seems unlikely Omoide will become a haunt of mine, although
until I find a better sushi place (and I fully intend to try), it may be somewhere
I revisit when I'm in the mood for Japanese food.
