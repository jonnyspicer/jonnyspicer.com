Argos is my new favourite thing, to the extent that I already don't understand how
I have previously functioned without one. You go to the store, order from a
touchscreen computer (no human interaction required) from a huge catalogue of products,
everything you could possibly think of, and at the click of a button and the swipe of
a card, your stuff comes down a conveyor and lands in your loving arms. I've been
several times already this week, and I love it.

This is what the convenience of capitalism is actually meant to be like, which makes
me 100% convinced that the company is evil and presumably exploiting both their
workers and their supply chain... but at least they aren't Amazon?
