Aside from visiting Rough Trade yesterday, while I was in Brick Lane I thought I ought to check out some of its fabled vintage clothing stores. I've never
been especially fashionable, but perhaps living in London is my opportunity to change that, as I am surrounded by inspiration and a lot less worried about
judgment. Moseying round the likes of Rokit and Beyond Retro was actually a lot more fun that I'd thought it might be, and I had to suppress the urge to
buy a slew of ridiculous items that were both impossibly cool and eye-wateringly expensive. In the end I managed to limit myself to just a couple of tie-dye
shirts, perfect for climbing or hot summer days, but I imagine I'll be going back again soon.
