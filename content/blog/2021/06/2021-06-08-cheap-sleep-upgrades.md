Everyone knows that sleep is the single best part of the human experience, and that getting enough high quality sleep is a silver bullet to pretty much all
your mental and physical problems. In London mine has definitely taken a bit of a dip, which was perhaps inevitable, but I'd like to get it back to where it
was in the relative peace and quiet of island life, my nocturnal sibling notwithstanding. To that end I have taken my usual approach of throwing money at
the problem, and bought myself an eye mask and some ear plugs, although they only set me back £25 (did you know, Bose sells a pair of ear plugs for ~£250
that connect to your phone to play white noise, but only connect to the Bose Sleep app and don't function as regular ear buds? I still can't wrap my head
around the gall of it). Tonight I'm planning on reading a chapter of my book before bed and then trying them both out, and fingers crossed I get the best
night's sleep I've had in a month.
