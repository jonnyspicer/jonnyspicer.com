I am far better than I'd like to be at pitying myself. When things don't turn out the way I want, I get stuck with a bad case of woeismeosis, and wallow in
it endlessly. Having lived such a privileged life where things by and large have been given to me on a silver platter, I've not put the effort into
unlearning this behaviour yet that I need to.

But self pity is truly a useless emotion, at least in the quantities in which I partake in it. I think London makes that all the more apparent - here nothing
is free, nobody owes you anything and you *are* nobody too, but equally you can have anything, do anything, be anything you want, if you put your mind to it.

For me it's a little like mindfulness, but instead of every time I find my mind wandering I return to my breath, every time I find myself feeling sorry for
myself I ask the question, "what am I going to do about it?"
