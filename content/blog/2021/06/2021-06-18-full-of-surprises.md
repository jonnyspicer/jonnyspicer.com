Yesterday one of my coworkers commented that I was full of surprises. I think she meant it as a compliment, or at least I chose to take it as one. Perhaps
when you get to know anybody first in a professional context, they are liable to be similarly surprising, and maybe the surprise is that I am less boring than
my nerdy, dry, periodically snarky programmer self.

I quite like the idea of being full of surprises - I guess it plays into my sense of narcissism. Perhaps I will continue aiming to be surprising in the future.
