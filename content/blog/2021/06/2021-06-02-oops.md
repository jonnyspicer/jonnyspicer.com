If you can see this, it means that I forgot to write a blog post today (or the Github actions runner had a moment and ran later than scheduled). Fortunately, having
made this mistake before, there's now a cron job that will post for me if. Sorry that I don't
have anything more interesting to say today, but at least I didn't lose any money! If you're
curious how this script works, you can read the post I wrote about it [here.](/blog/old-site-new-home-ii-new-stuff/)
