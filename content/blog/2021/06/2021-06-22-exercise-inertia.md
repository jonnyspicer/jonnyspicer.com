I've been really struggling to find the motivation to exercise recently. I don't know what it is, but there's been so much inertia to break in order to
lace up my shoes and head out the door. I thought I might be tired, but I took over a week off running last week so I don't think it's that. I feel like
I have been eating and sleeping better, but now suddenly can't find the energy to get out and move.

This evening was a perfect example - I had signed up for a group run at 6pm, but was desperate to eat dinner early and curl up in bed. The amount of willpower
it took to not do that and go out running instead felt superhuman, and there's no way I would've accomplished it unless a) it was with a group b) I'd
specifically put my name down for it and c) I had a trail marathon in 12 days time.

They say willpower is a finite resource, so perhaps I am using it all up on something else during my day. I have no idea what though, but I hope I can figure
it out soon, as I am getting more and more scared that my next race is going to entail a rather large amount of suffering.
