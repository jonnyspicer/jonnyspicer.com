The ultramarathon I had entered at the end of next month got cancelled yesterday, and I must confess I'm not actually that upset. Obviously I really wanted
to do it, but I've struggled to get enough training done and was getting quite worried it was going to be a sufferfest. I still theoretically have the
marathon in 10 days time, but I've also heard no communication whatsoever from them since entering, so who knows... Assuming that race does go ahead, it'll
be nice to know I don't need to finish with anything in the tank and can break myself to get over the line if needs be.

I have already looked at some alternative ultras, but I'm not too sure what I'm going to do yet - I'm going to re-evaluate after my upcoming race. Taking a
break from running, or at least taking a break from running quite so seriously, might be healthy, as I'm not entirely convinced I've been enjoying it
very much recently. It'll be nice to take some pressure off, and maybe I'll spend more time climbing or reading or sleeping instead.
