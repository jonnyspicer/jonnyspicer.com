For the last day of my days off, I headed to Vauxwall East this morning, to cross another London climbing gym off my to-visit list. I'd seen videos of the
inside and knew that they had some cool walls and problems, but what I didn't know is that they have a replica of the Freerider boulder problem on El Capitan,
the one featured in [Free Solo](/blog/free-solo). The replica was even set, certified and climbed by Honnold himself, so it's the real deal.

Obviously free soloing El Cap is a feat completely beyond my comprehension. I can't imagine conquering my fears with such totality that I'd be able to perform
at the level required to free every pitch on El Cap (obviously I couldn't even do most of the pitches even if they were all single-pitch and I had a rope).
They make a big deal of the boulder problem in the documentary, and so you know it's a big deal. But to actually try and do a replica, knowing that were this
the real thing one mistake would cause you to *fall to your death*, adds even more context to Honnold's mind-boggling achievement.

I had not just climbed 15 pitches when I tried the problem, so I was a lot fresher than Honnold would've been at that point. I couldn't even do the first move - were I in his tight-fitting, rubber climbing shoes, I would've plummeted to my demise on the floor of the Yosemite Valley.
