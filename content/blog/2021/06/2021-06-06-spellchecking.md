Today I have made a massive improvement to the blog; I installed a spellchecking extension on my IDE. I've had the rainbow brackets one for years, but a
humble spellchecker has never seemed like a priority, but today after noticing that I published something featuring the word "hte", I realised it was time
for a change.

Sadly the extension obviously can't correct either my grammar or my faulty brain, but hopefully you appreciate it nonetheless.
