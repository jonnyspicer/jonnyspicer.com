This evening I booked my vaccination appointments - one for bright and early tomorrow morning in Fleet Street, and the other in late August which is going to require me to schlep all the
way to Wimbledon. Perhaps I'll stay the night and call it a staycation. Either way, finally getting vaccinated and being able to mingle worry-free will be a huge relief, and will
hopefully pave the way for international travel before the end of the year. Just like everyone else, I have my fingers crossed that this marks the beginning of the end.
