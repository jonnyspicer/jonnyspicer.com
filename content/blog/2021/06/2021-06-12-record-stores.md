Today is [Record Store Day](https://recordstoreday.co.uk/about-rsd/about/) here in the UK, so I decided to head to fashionable Brick Lane and check out the
legendary Rough Trade record store. I've been to record stores a handful of times, and it's always a funny experience - I know I am never going to buy any
vinyl, because a) I don't have a record player and b) my bank statement doesn't have room to fund another expensive habit in my life. Despite these things,
I love flicking through the rows, trying to find some kind of hidden gem that I might buy in an alternate universe. Not buying any of it makes me a little
sad, as they are things I would love to own and thing I would get a lot of pleasure from, so the act of going into the store to stare forlornly and the
thousands of cardboard covers is a slightly masochistic experience.

Still, *one day* I will have a record player, and a bigger wallet, and I'll finally be able to actually buy things from places like Rough Trade. And I think
when that day comes, I will be a very happy camper.
