As my favourite blogging fun-player [points out,](https://tedslocum.com/daily/2021/01/09/Bizarre-Blogging) the rising price of ethereum is making this bet spicier
by the day. Of course, in a month's time, ETH may well have cratered again and we're back to doing this purely for bragging rights, but if it's going to the moon, things are only
going to get wilder. Personally I'm glad, I think gambling is only fun when what you have to lose actually means something to you.

There are various technical failsafes I could put in, but have not yet got round to, but this week I think it might be worth spending a few hours getting some cron magic hooked up...
