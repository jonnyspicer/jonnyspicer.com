Today is supposed to be the worst day of the year - cold, wet, dark, back at work with the holidays already long forgotten. As a habitually blue person in general, today was actually
a pleasant surprise - I didn't mind any of the bad things about today, and had the excitement of starting a new job to buoy my spirits. After a couple of months of not working, it
was great to finally get back to having something to focus my energy on, and I really liked everybody that I got to meet on my first day. Admittedly it was mostly admin and I haven't
had a chance to get stuck into anything technical yet, but there's plenty of time for that.

If today is the worst day of the year for me, then I am seriously excited about what the rest of 2021 looks like.
