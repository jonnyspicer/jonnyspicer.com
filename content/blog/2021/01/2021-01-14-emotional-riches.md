Ted often describes my life as being "emotionally rich", in comparison to his which I would characterise as "emotionally consistent". I'm still not entirely sure whether he means it
as a bad thing, a good thing, or neither. Either way, I know where he's coming from; there always seems to be a lot going on in my head, something that I am having particularly strong
feelings about, or different things pulling me in different directions.

Occasionally it's fun, but most of the time it's exhausting and I hate it. That's certainly how I feel right now, burned out of my own feelings. I don't want to be especially happy,
I just want some consistency, even if that means I'm consistently feeling just OK about things. Maybe I ought to ask Ted for some lessons.
