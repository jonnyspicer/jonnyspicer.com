One of my first reactions to the news of the new lockdown yesterday was to worry about my weight. I'm not going to be able to exercise as much, I'm going to be in a very well-stocked
house a lot more of the time, there's more reason to comfort eat then before. After finally having got into what felt like a healthy, sustainable routine both in terms of diet and
activity, I'm pretty gutted to have that disrupted so quickly. Like I said yesterday, I know that I need to muster up as much self compassion as I can, but I also know I'm going to be
so upset if I put on any weight in the next few weeks.
