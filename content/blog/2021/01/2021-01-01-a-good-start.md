title: A Good Start
---
I think everyone on the planet is hoping that 2021 is a better year than 2020 was, myself very much included. One day in, and it's been a good start; I went for a run followed by
a particularly bracing swim in the sea, I did a little bit of work, I ate some cheesecake. I have no complaints, and hopefully the trajectory of this year continues.
