I'd like to retract all the good things [I previously said] about running in the dark. Having been out after sunset for a run the last three days in a row, each time has been cold,
wet, dark (obviously) and miserable. Not having anything to look at to distract and having to keep laser focused on the dim light of my headtorch shining 5 feet away is tedious and
does little to distract me from the damp and the dull ache of my entire body.

Sometimes running feels like an act of pure masochism, and this week ahs been one of those weeks.
