It feels like I have an infinite list of things to do before flying back to Guernsey first thing on Monday morning. Every time I tick off
one mildly-anxiety-inducing chore, two more spring up to take its place, and I'm starting to realise why Hercules was so worthy of his
1997 Disney movie.

Still, fortunately I have now at least made a dent in my own personal twelve labours, and have got my Christmas shopping sorted more
than a fortnight after my arbitrarily self-imposed deadline. This, crucially, is still more than a week before the point I got my
Christmas shopping sorted last year, and I can now fully relax into the festive atmosphere while there's still some left.
