Well, it finally happened, and today I tested positive for everyone's favourite novel coronavirus. I have to self isolate for at least 7 days, and remain on Guernsey for at least 10, so
it has thrown a spanner in the works to my plans for the immediate future.

Obviously, it is frustrating for a myriad of reasons. But it's a great time to try and put into practice some Stoicism and fully accept that being upset will not change my situation.
I am fortunately asymptomatic, so I can at least do stuff while I'm in my room, like yoga or algorithm practice like I seemingly jinxed myself with yesterday.

Hopefully I can at least make the most of this bad situation.
