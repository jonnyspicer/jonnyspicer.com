Today I got my booster jab, at a community centre 10 minutes walk away that was offering walk-in appointments. I was amazed at the speed of
the whole process - when I joined the back of a queue that stretched down the street, I was fully prepared to wait in line for a couple of
hours, but it moved at an impressive pace. Once the time came for me to have the jab I understood why - I sat down, the nurse asked me if I
was afraid of needles, and I'd scarcely finished replying "no" before she'd stuck one in me. After a brief ten minutes in the waiting room
to check I wasn't going to throw up or pass out or have a heart attack, I could once again go on my merry way.

Despite my best attempts to avoid ingesting the news at all costs, it's still apparent to me that things are getting worse all around, and
we could be headed for more restrictions in the new year. I'm not going to spend too much time thinking or worrying about that, and will
do my best to cross that bridge if and when we collectively come to it, but ahead of flying home next week, it's definitely nice to have the
peace of mind that the extra innoculation offers.
