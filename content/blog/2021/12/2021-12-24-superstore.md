So far, my plan to do anything productive during my time in isolation is going poorly, as I have instead watched two full seasons of NBC sitcom *Superstore*. The characters are fun and
relatable, the writing is good enough to occasionally make me snort through my nose and above all the show is incredibly comfortable, which is exactly what I need right now.

Still, lying in bed all day binge watching only-slightly-above-average American sitcoms... it's just like being horribly depressed at university all over again.
