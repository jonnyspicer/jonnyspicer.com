Well, this Christmas did not go entirely to plan. I had hoped to go for a swim and a run, or at the very least to venture outside
the house for a walk, but instead I'm housebound. At least we could all exchange presents, albeit while sporting facemasks, and the
food was a highlight.

At least I am another day closer to being able to touch grass again, and the bar has been set suitably low for next year.
