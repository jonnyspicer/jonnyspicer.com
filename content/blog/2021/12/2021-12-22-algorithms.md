After having done so much Advent of Code, I realised that while I am very bad at algorithms, I should at least give myself credit for knowing more than nothing about them, despite my lack
of formal computer science education. Given I have quite a lot of free time over the next couple of weeks, and quite a high desire to write code, I want to see how quickly I can get to
being passable at data structures and algorithms.

I am hoping that I can get through some of the basics fairly quickly after brushing up on my complexity analysis. Fortunately I think I'm already fairly familiar with some parts of the
topic, like logs, recursion and sliding window algorithms, but others will require a lot more work, like tree and graph traversal, sorting algorithms and dynamic programming.
Fortunately there are hundreds of amazing, free resources like [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com) that make learning and practicing this
stuff incredibly easy.

Hopefully in a couple of weeks I'll at least be able to reverse a linked list.
