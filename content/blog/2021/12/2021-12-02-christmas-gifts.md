This year I am making a concerted effort to get into the Christmas spirit and be less of a Scrooge than I usually am. Part of my plan to enjoy the whole affair was to have all of my Christmas shopping down *before* December, thus forgoing all of the usual stress that
usually accompanies the last minute dash to buy presents for everyone.

Needless to say, that did not happen. The good news is, I did manage to start today, and hopefully I'll have it done by the end of the weekend. And then I can really start to enjoy the carols, mulled wine and fancy trees.
