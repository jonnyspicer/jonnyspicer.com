Whenever I get up at 6am and begin my day, I feel like I have my life on track. It feels like a hack to get more time, to squeeze an
extra couple of hours into my day that nobody else has because they're asleep. When it's dark outside, there's something romantic about
being sat by my SAD light, while none of the other windows in my courtyard are lit up, and I am attempting to write some code or make a
coffee or play some chess.

With London having been so hectic thus far, regularly getting an early start hasn't felt plausible. But now that I am finding a good
rhythm, my routine is settling and things are a little more peaceful, a gentle shift in my sleep schedule might be the missing piece of
the puzzle.
