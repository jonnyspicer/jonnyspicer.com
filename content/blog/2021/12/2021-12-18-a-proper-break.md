Yesterday was my last day of work before the Christmas holidays, and my next day won't be until the 4th, or potentially even the 7th, of January. It's the first time I've had more than a week off since I started this job back in January, when, admittedly, I had had about
2.5 months off. I think the extended break will be incredibly healthy and I'm really looking forward to it, I hope I can cast work to the back of my mind for the full duration, and spend some productive time thinking about my career and what direction I want to go in
without the distraction of Jira tickets, code reviews and fixing flaky tests.

With that being said, I did spend 6 hours programming today. Advent of Code has really managed to capture my attention, and I am loving trying to solve the now rather difficult challenges.
