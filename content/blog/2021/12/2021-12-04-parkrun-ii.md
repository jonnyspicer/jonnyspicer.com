Today I achieved another of my [goals for this year,](/blog/2021-goals-ii) and ran my 50th [parkrun](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/) event
at Clapham Common. It was probably one of my slowest ever, which isn't surprising given I'm on course for my highest volume week to date,
but I got to do it with someone else which made it infinitely more enjoyable. Doing 50 parkruns feels like a surprisingly big achievement,
and I feel proud not because I've set any PBs or ran any particular distance, but just because I've been consistent in waking up early on
enough Saturdays in the last 2.5 years to earn myself a t-shirt.

There have been fast parkruns, slow parkruns, hungover parkruns, still-drunk parkruns, solo parkruns and group parkruns, parkruns in three
different countries and parkruns on tarmac, dart, grass and sand. The last 50 have been great, and I can't wait to do another 50 and bag
myself another t-shirt.
