In the process of packing to go back to Guernsey tomorrow, I finished *un*packing from moving into my new flat over a month ago. It's funny how easy it is to constantly knock things down the priority list, but I feel a palpable sense of relief now my living room is no
longer littered with packs, and that feeling is going someway to offset my travel anxiety. My fridge is finally covered in mementos again, my walls are adorned with posters and paintings, and I can actually see the majority of the floor in here. I even cleaned and
vacuumed, obviously as a means to procrastinate preparing for tomorrow's journey, but it will be very worth it - I am already excited to come back to my flat again.
