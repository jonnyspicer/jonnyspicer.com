Today I'm moving flat, from Bermondsey to Kennington. It has been a little sad to pack everything up, and my walls look alarmingly bare without posters adorning them, but overall I am excited about the move. When I first moved here I envisioned transforming my new home
into a place of peace and quiet, of light and houseplants, but it hasn't turned out that way for various reasons. Now I am more settled in London and less at the whim of its chaotic nature, my hope to build myself a sanctuary has been refreshed, and hopefully today
marks the next step towards building some kind of sustainable happiness for me here in the city.

With that being said, I have hired a van which I will be driving myself, and I am absolutely terrified. Motorists, pedestrains, and inanimate roadside objects of London, watch out.
