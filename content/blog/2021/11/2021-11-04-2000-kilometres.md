I have decided to set myself a last minute challenge for 2021, so that I can finish off the year strong and hopefully start 2022 off on the right foot - I am going to aim to run 2000km for the year. I have already run 1,656.8km so I have a mere 343.2km to go, and 58 days
in which to run them. This equates to roughly 41.5km a week for the next 8 and a bit weeks, or 5.92km a day from here until January 1st, both of which seem like an abundantly achievable amount of running if I find the mental fortitude to run in the cold and the wet and
stop drinking quite so much - after my birthday of course.

If I can achieve a little bit of consistency with my running to close out the year then I'll be in a great place to start considering some ambitious goals for 2022... so good luck me.
