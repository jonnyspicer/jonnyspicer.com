In a week's time I'll be turning 27 and obviously I have plenty of thoughts about that, but I'll save those for another post. On Saturday it is my birthday celebration, and so far my predominant emotion about it is stress. I am trying to recoup money off people, find
replacements for those that can't come, and overall make sure that whatever we end up doing is sufficiently fun that all my friends have a good time, which is a lot of pressure. I have a pretty fun day planned on my actual birthday, but that's because I'll spending the
whole day by myself, doing pretty much exactly whatever I want to do.

Anyway, the point is that it's easy to forget that sometimes it is completely OK to make everything about me, and my birthday is one of those days. If my friends don't like it then I guess they're bad friends.
