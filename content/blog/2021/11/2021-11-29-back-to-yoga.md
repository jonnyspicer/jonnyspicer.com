This weekend I attempted to do yoga for the first time in months. After having done so much of it over the start of the year, I'd hoped I wouldn't have lost all progress and might retain some of my strength and mobility progress in the past few months of unabashedly
shirking my practice. I am feeling the effects of spending so long at my desk, and while my back does not hurt per se, I feel like it's on course to do so. Plus, if I am serious about doing a serious ultra next year, I need some serious core strength, so I'd better start
working on it ASAP.

Alas, it was not to be - I sucked. I have the core strength of a souffl√©. My hips have the range of motion of a pair of long-rusted scissors. My whole body is deeply unimpressed with my brazen attempt to destroy it one asana at a time.

I guess being that bad is good motivation, and I know I'll see rapid improvement in the next week or so. And it'll be so worth it when I no longer feel like a young man in an old man's body.
