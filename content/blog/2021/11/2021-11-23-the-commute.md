Now I've moved flat, I am no longer quite within walking distance of the office and instead have to take some kind of public transport in order to get there on time without leaving before sunrise. I've been incredibly lucky
in that so far in my career I've only ever walked to work, so it's been a bit of a shock to suddenly be negotiating the tube at rush hour - even though I know that there are fewer commuters than previously as lots of companies
continue to advocate and allow for working from home. The tube... sucks. I honestly, truly have no idea how people do long commutes five days a week, I think after a month of doing it I'd already be irreconcilably miserable.

Fortunately, I need to run more, and running with a backpack is good practice for running ultras with a heavy vest, so it looks like that's going to be my new form of commute.
