I know that I frequently lament that the quality of my blog isn't better, or at least more consistent, and I'm afraid this is yet another one of those posts. I have so many things I want to write about, so many things I think might actually be genuinely valuable and
interesting and at the very least not the tenth rehash of a concept, but I am struggling to write them. There are two main reasons I think. The first is a lack of time, and when there isn't a lack of time, a lack of energy. I am so busy, all of the time, and whenever I
do have a couple of hours free, the chances of me having enough mental clarity to string multiple coherent sentences together is appreciably close to zero. The second is fear. I've been thinking a lot about my own mental health lately, even more than usual, and I have
plenty of things that I feel would be good to share about it. But I'm scared, still. I guess at least that's normal.

I am hoping that with Christmas coming up, one of the things I will be able to spend at least some of my time off work doing is writing. But I won't get my hopes up too much, and neither should you.
