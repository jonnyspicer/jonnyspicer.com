Last night I saw English indie pop/new wave legends Metronomy play live in the Colour Factory (a converted warehouse) in Hackney Wick, East London. It was absolutely incredible.

I've already seen Metronomy twice before, at the 2012 and 2014 editions of Reading Festival, and their 2012 performance still ranks in my mind as one of the best gigs I've ever been to, hence my decision to go see them again a third time. They are just all so effortlessly cool - five talented musicians,
all clearly good friends, having a great time together on stage, allowing the crowd to equally effortlessly have a great time along with them. After opening one of their newer songs, they followed up with *Everything Goes My Way* off their 2011 modern classic *The English Riveira* and the whole crowd
lit up, chanting drummer and temporary vocalist Anna Prior's name throughout. Their set list was perfect, a great mix of old crowd favourites and new bangers, and even included a deep cut from their 2008 record *Nights Out*, recorded and released when the band had a very different lineup, that I can't
imagine gets wheeled out at many gigs.

There is something very special about live music; I sincerely believe touring bands have worked out some kind of method of imbuing what they play with magic. Metronomy's live shows are bass-y, synth-y and abundantly danceable, and they clearly have a dedicated fanbase. Not only was the crowd, myself
included, singing along to all the words, they were singing all of the instrumentals too.

I can't wait to have another opportunity to go and see them again soon.
