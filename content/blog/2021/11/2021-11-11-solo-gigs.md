I'm about to go out to my first gig since moving to London, and I'll be going on my own. I had a couple of others that I had tickets for already, but one I decided to sack off seeing as I'd seen the band a couple of weeks prior at a festival and the other I was so hungover
that I flat out didn't realise what day it was.

Part of me is quite apprehensive about going to a gig on my own, but another part of me is quite excited by the prospect. I know that I want to make the most out of living in London, and I want to experience as much of it as I possibly can, and I know that I'm not going to
be able to find someone to accompany to do all the things that I want to do, so I need to get used to doing them on my own. Plus going to a gig solo means I don't have to be self conscious around one of my friends if I am vibing especially hard with the music.

Weirdly I still have a bit of anxiety about going to the cinema on my own, but that's the next thing to conquer, and after that, I'll be onto the big one; solo travelling.
