One of the things I shall miss most about my current flat is its proximity to the [Watchhouse](https://watchhouse.com/) roastery, currently a mere 2 minutes away but soon to be a whole 40 minutes on the bus. Its coffee, both in espresso and bean form, has become a staple
of my week and I have yet to find anywhere that does it quite as well, or manage to replicate even an approximation of it myself. The breakfast burritos there are my favourite go-to hangover breakfast, the staff are lovely, the whole place is maybe slightly pretentious
but it feels so chic, modern and alarmingly sophisticated. Every time I go in the door, I feel like I am a young professional making it in the big city, which is a pretty cool feeling, at least for now.

Fortunately there's another Watchhouse right next to the office though, so it's not as if I'm going to have to go out of my way to enjoy delicious coffee and brownies from there anytime soon.
