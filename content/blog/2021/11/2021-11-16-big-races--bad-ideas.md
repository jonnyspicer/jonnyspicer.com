Another classic "quick one because I have no time" today.

You're meant to take years to build up to running ultramarathons. The stress they put on your body is immense, and you need to have a really solid foundational of strength and running form before you can expect any kind of success in them - and in the ultra game, most of
the time success takes the shape of simply finishing the race.

I do not have years of experience. I do however have buckets of both impatience and naïveté and so I've entered the ballot for a ridiculous race next summer, that is far beyond my abilities. It's a bad idea to try and do this race, but I love bad ideas.

All will be revealed on December 2nd when I find out whether or not I've won a place.
