Recently, I've finally managed to start enjoying cooking, something that's never really been the case. I think it's due to a combination of factors; having my own, now reasonably well-equipped kitchen, a lighter wallet and larger waistline from eating out too much, and
likely most importantly, having someone to cook for that I'm looking to impress.

Finding time for it is still difficult, but working from home makes it infinitely easier, especially as I can now prepare things before work or at lunch. But overall it's exciting; in London I can get any ingredient I want, and there are a million different cuisines to
try recipes from. Maybe if software engineering doesn't pan out then I'll open up a food truck or something.
