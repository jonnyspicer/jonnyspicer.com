This weekend my quest to find somewhere to live in Lonon begun in earnest. I put it off a fair bit, beginning the process felt quite overwhelming and anxiety-inducing, but now the
ball is rolling and I am really, really excited. I've already heard back from a few lettings agents, and even had a flat that seems to tick all the boxes - great location, well within
budget, has all but one of my nice-to-haves.

As such I am deeply, deeply suspicious; things should not be this easy.
