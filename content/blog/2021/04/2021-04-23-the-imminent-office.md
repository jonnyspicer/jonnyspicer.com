This month, our office has optionally re-opened to employees for the first time in over a year.
Obviously I'm still very much in the wrong geographic location in order to take advantage of
this myself, but I've had a few video calls with colleagues that have made it into HQ, and it
looks *amazing*. Given I have decided to shell out on living as close to the office as possible, I plan on going in more often than not in order to make the most of it, and I'm super excited.
I've only ever worked in offices consisting of one main open-plan room and a meeting room,
and even then, they've not necessarily been the nicest open-plan and meeting rooms in the world. Going into a big, fancy London office in the middle of big, fancy London is going to
be an experience that I love, and I am hoping I will be able to hold onto its novelty for as
long as possible.
