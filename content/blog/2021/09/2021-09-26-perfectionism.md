My boss gave me some great advice the other day. He said that I always want everything I build to be perfect, and that it'd hugely benefit my career if I focused on delivering the next most valuable thing, rather than continuing to work on something that was already
working well but might not be textbook code. He's exactly right, but he didn't say that this will require untangling my ego from my output, which I think is going to be the hard thing about it. It's good advice for my personal life too - I would do well to be able to
recognise what is the next most important thing for my health and happiness, rather than trying to push something to its limits.
