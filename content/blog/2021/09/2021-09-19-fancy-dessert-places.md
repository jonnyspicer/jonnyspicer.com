One of my favourite things about Lonodn is the proliferation of fancy dessert places to try. Today I got round to ticking off another one on the list - [T's Fried Scoop](http://tsfriedscoop.com/) purveyors of the seemingly paradoxical fried ice cream. It was delicious, in a
great location at the heart of Brick Lane, and good value for money compared to its competitors, so I'd highly recommend it. Other
highlights so far have included [Zizi Factory,](https://www.instagram.com/zizifactorylondon/) [Humble Crumble](https://www.humble-crumble.com/) and [Chin Chin,](https://chinchinicecream.com/) with the next on the to-try list being [Cr√®me.](https://cremelondon.com/) It's a good
job I run so much...
