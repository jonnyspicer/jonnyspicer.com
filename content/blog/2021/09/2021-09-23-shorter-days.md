The days are getting shorter, and I already hate it. Opening my curtains and not seeing the sun first thing is tough. Writing this at half 7 in the evening and it already being completely dark out is tough. Maybe it's just a coincidence around other things going on in my
life, but this week has been a difficult one mental health wise, and I feel like I need a week lying on a beach in the broadest of sunlight to get me back on track.

I guess it's time to buy another SAD lamp.
