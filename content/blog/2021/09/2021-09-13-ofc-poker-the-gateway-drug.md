I have recently been playing some Open Face Chinese Poker again, having got a certain non-gambling card game aficionado hooked on it. We've only been playing for pride and not money, but I working on changing that. OFC is a pretty perfect gateway drug for gambling; it's
fast paced, it's swingy, and you always feel like if you just play *one more hand* then you'll hit it big and recoup your losses. So perhaps I shouldn't be encouraging them to get into it too much, just in case... But still, I am having a huge amount of fun playing it.
I've even downloaded the app again and am more than open to offers to play up to Â£1/point...
