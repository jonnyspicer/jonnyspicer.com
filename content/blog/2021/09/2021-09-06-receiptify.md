There is a slew of simple little apps that use the Spotify API to give you data on your listening habits (much of which I am surprised Spotify don't offer themselves through their UI), and today I found another one, [Receiptify.](https://receiptify.herokuapp.com/) The
app is relatively straightforward and built with Node, the code for which can be found [here.](https://github.com/watchinharrison/receiptify) I'm not entirely convinced of the accuracy of the data, based on my results, but I don't know whether that's the fault of
Spotify's API or the app itself. My results were... wholly unsurprising. Car Seat Headrest's *Fill in the Blank* is my #9 most played song of the last month, #3 in the last six months, and (confusingly) both #1 and #9 on my all time list. CSH dominate my all time top 10
occupying five of the slots, with two of the remaining going to Arcade Fire, and then one each for Polyphia, You Slut!, and Neutral Milk Hotel. My most played this month is [family ties](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6HBZC9pZHQ) by Baby Keem & Kendrick Lamar, and if
you haven't listened to it then you absolutely should.
