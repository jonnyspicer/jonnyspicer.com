Today is the second of four consecutive weekends where I plan to get out of the city; Eden Valley last Saturday, Weybridge today, Tring next week, and a whole long weekend in Scotland the week after that. After catching up with an old friend last night about my time in
London so far, I realised quite how much I am loving it here, but spending time apart seems key to maintaining a healthy relationship. My hope that the city would serve as a convenient base from which to explore the rest of the UK has so far been fulfilled; hopefully next
year the same can be said for my hope that it can also be a place from which I can explore the rest of the world.
