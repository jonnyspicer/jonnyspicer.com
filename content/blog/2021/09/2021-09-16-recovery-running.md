As my post yesterday illustrated, stress is high this week, and it hasn't been helped by the fact that between tapering and recovery, I've not been out running as much as I usually would, and have missed out on some of the mental health effects jogging brings. In my
incredibly limited past experience, it takes 5-7 days after an effort like [Saturday's](/blog/eden-valley-ultra-trail) before I can run again without being in a lot of pain, but yesterday I knew I needed to at least try for the sake of my sanity. Amazingly, it was fine -
it was slow, and my heartrate was high, but my legs felt good, it felt easy, and it felt so good to get out of the flat and mosey down the river for a bit. Obviously it seems like a good sign in terms of my physical fitness, but more than that it has made me even more
grateful to be able to run.
