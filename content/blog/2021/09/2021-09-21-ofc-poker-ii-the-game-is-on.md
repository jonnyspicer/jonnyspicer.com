After getting absolutely crushed by them in a game at the weekend, I've persuaded my OFC protégé to play
for money, at £0.10/point. It feels nice to be playing microstakes again but still finding it fun, and the
financial skin in the game only being a way to enhance the experience rather than the focal point of it. I
am also very excited to win myself some chicken dinners.
