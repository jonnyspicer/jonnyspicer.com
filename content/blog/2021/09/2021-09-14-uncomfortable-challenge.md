I too have been thinking that I'd benefit from some kind of [uncomfortable challenge.](https://tedslocum.com/daily/2021/09/13/Uncomfortable-Challenge) I am far too comfortable, in far too many ways, and it serves me poorly. Some kind of way to gamify it or hold myself
accountable would be great - be that in the form of a freeroll, part of my journalling habit, or simply trying to start a new series about it here. Hopefully in a couple of days I'll have a fully-formed idea to share.
