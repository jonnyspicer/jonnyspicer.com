Last night I went to [Flight Club](https://flightclubdarts.com/london/) for the first time, which fortunately has an altogether different set of rules to its pugnacious namesake, so I am allowed to read a blog about it. It was a lot of fun, with affordable(ish) cocktails
and a speakeasy vibe, as well as an opportunity to let one's competitive side out; I'm happy to report that I won, so I guess it turns out that I'm not so bad at darts. Being able to do things like Flight Club has been one of my favourite things about London so far, and
I'm glad I've been able to get out of my comfort zone and make the most of having a slew of new experiences on offer here.
