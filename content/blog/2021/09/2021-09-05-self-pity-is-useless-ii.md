I've been thinking about self pity a lot more this week, in part because I realised I've been feeling it recently. It's still useless. I am
very good at slipping into it, focusing on everything else except my mental health, and then lamenting that I am "still" feeling down... even
though I'm not doing anything to actually try and change that. Good one, you idiot.

I think it was an epiphany that specifically struck during [IDLES' set on Friday,](/blog/wide-awake) so shout out to them. Realising it
actually felt very good. Suddenly remembering that I can cut out so many parts of my week, and quieten so much noise, in order to actually
work on my self esteem, boundaries and overcoming anxiety, and that *doing this work will actually make a difference* is a weirdly self-fulfilling prophecy. It is quite frustrating that I seem to get distracted and lose sight of this so consistently, and I'm not entirely
sure why that is yet, but for now I think all that matters is to keep trying to build habits that take responsibility for my mental health,
and to persevere as long as it takes for them to stick.
