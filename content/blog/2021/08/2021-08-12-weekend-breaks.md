When I moved to London, I knew that the city would get overwhelming after a while. The plan was (and still is) to hop on a train and go somewhere else at the weekend as often as is feasible, and ideally spend some nights away from the noise and light pollution that London
offers after dark. So far the only night away I've had has been in a thoroughly mediocre hotel in Reigate, and pretty much all I did was get food from Morrison's, eat it in my room, and sleep. Fortunately this weekend that is about to change as I am off to Leeds to do
more of the kind of weekend escaping that I'd had in mind; I'm going to spend the weekend with a friend and we're going to get some outdoor climbing done, and probably go for a couple of runs too. And eat, I'm planning on doing a lot of that.

While I've never been to Leeds, I've heard it's not a radical departure from London, so it isn't perhaps the city-detox I would like, but it'll be great to be able to climb outdoors again, something I've been hugely missing since having been here.
