A week later and the results are in, and they are deeply underwhelming. As far as I can tell, nothing really changed, except for the fact I
missed the taste of coffee and the ritual of making it for a week. It's obviously hard to control every other variable that might've affected
my sleep or my focus, but there were certainly no drastic improvements or degradations, and no noticeable withdrawal symptoms either. Given
I usually only have one cup a day, and never after noon, I don't think it's particularly surprising, but I guess it is healthy to reassure
myself that I haven't developed any kind of dependency on it.

It also has the added benefit of making me excited about coffee again. I bought some more expensive beans than I've been using previously,
and they're delicious. I watched some more videos on brewing methods, so I can hone my technique. If I am only going to have one cup a day,
I'm excited to try and make it the best cup possible.
