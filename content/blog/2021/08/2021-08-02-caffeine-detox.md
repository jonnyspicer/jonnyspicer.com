While some are [dabbling in caffeine again,](https://tedslocum.com/daily/2021/07/30/Knowing-what-good) I have decided to take a week off from it, starting today, to see what happens. The potential upside that I am hoping to see is better sleep and less grogginess in the
mornings, and I am hoping to avoid any headaches or similar. It would be nice to feel more alert during the day too, but we'll see.
