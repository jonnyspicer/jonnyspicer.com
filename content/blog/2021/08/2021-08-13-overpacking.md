Apologies in advance for this low effort post; I have about 10 minutes in which to write it.

I'm now all packed for Leeds, and can't help but feel like I have taken far too much stuff. I've got a big rucksack that I believe has 40L capacity, and it's full, albeit with suboptimal packing. For two nights away this seems excessive, and the maximalism of it makes me
feel gross. But with all my climbing stuff, all my running stuff and a laptop, perhaps it's unavoidable.
