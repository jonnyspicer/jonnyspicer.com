This morning I got my second jab, something I, and many others, have been wanting and waiting for for a long time. It feels like a huge relief, and hopefully marks the start of a change for the better. I'm excited to be able to leave my house without worrying (or at least
worrying less) about human contact, and to be able to go to gigs and on planes, eventually.

While the vaccine has provided me with a big emotional boost, it's physical effects have been a lot less enjoyable - circa 12 hours after my appointment and I feel exhausted, and ache all over. Hopefully a good night's sleep will fix all that, as I would rather not be
robbed of an enjoyable weekend, even if it is obviously a small price to pay.
