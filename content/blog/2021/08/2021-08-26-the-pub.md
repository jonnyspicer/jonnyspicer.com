Another quick one today because I have to leave the house in seven minutes in order to be on time for meeting a friend at the pub. I love the pub, but I distinctly don't love drinking, and wish it didn't feel like a necessity in order to bond with people in a new place.
I would really, really, really like to feel at my best tomorrow, but I also know that I'm not good at stopping after only one or two pints. Hopefully this time I will be able to be better at not succumbing to peer pressure and can still have an enjoyable evening getting
to know someone better but still be in a fit state to get up and go for a run first thing tomorrow morning.
