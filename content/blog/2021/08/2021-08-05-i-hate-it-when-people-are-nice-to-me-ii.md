Apparently I don't do a particularly good job of hiding how much I don't like it when people are nice to me. This morning one of my coworkers send me a link to [this,](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/brain_compliments) saying it reminded me of them. And... yeah, I think
it pretty much hits the nail on the head.
