I think I'm really bad at prioritizing, and it's often my undoing. I know that I ought to prioritise my physical and mental health first, and focus on sleeping and eating well above all else, but I don't. I allow many things to compete for my attention and it always
results in forgetting about the basics, letting them slip, and then suffering for it. Every so often I realise what I'm doing, and go back to putting the important things first, but then inevitably I slowly try to add more things into the mix until my priorities are askew
once again.

I think I'm going to write them out and stick them on my fridge. Hopefully that way I won't forget.
