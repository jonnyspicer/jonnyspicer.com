As we near the end of Q3, I am happy to report that I've either already completed, or am on track for, most of my [2021 goals.](/blog/2021-goals) I've run not one, but two marathons, I've read a tonne of books, I am
fairly comfortable with Golang, and am keeping pace with both the blogging and the journalling. Now I'm in
London and have access to a variety of different gyms, climbing a V5 in one seems like it's not such a
helpful goal anymore, as a V5 in one gym might be a V2 or a V8 elsewhere. After next month I will have completed the next goal I set myself for this year; to get the qualification points for the [OCC.](/blog/utmb-i-occ/) Which means I need a new set of goals and things to work towards, but I haven't
entirely decided what yet... I think the process of doing so is going to be a lot of fun though. Perhaps it'll give me something to mull over when I'm grinding out the trail ultras in a few short weeks time.
