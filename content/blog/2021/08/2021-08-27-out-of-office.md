My out of office is on, and it will remain so until Monday 6th September. I quite enjoy my job, but it is still a job, and there is no better feeling than knowing that I am going to get a full 9 days respite from emails, Slack messages and Jira tickets. Despite the
chaos of the city around me, I feel peaceful and content in a way I haven't in a long time. Hopefully, if I ever make it to retirement, this is what it's going to feel like, only on a grander scale.
