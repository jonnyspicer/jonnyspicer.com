On Sunday night I managed to get out for a pain-free run for the first time in two and a half weeks. One of the silver linings of being injured is that on the first run back, my legs feel totally fresh, and I felt like I was floating through the sleep streets of London.
It was a nice temperature, there weren't many people about and the only ones who were seemed to be couples enjoying romantic moments by the river. The city looks beautiful at night, and it was a rarity to not run along the banks of the Thames without having to slalom
my way through revellers and tourists alike. I had my favourites playlist on and for a blissful 40 minutes, forgot all about the fact that I had work again the next day.

I guess I do like running. Sometimes.
