My next target race, the [Eden Valley Ultra Trail,](https://edenvalleyrace.com/) is now less than two weeks away, which means I've started tapering for it. Tapering is actually pretty nice as it turns out - instead of being worried about doing enough mileage to gain
fitness before the race, I know that I'm not going to get any fitter, I just need to get as fresh as possible, so my focus is on doing the bare minimum mileage to keep my legs ticking over and getting to race day feeling sharp and ready to go. The sudden flip in mentality
is a welcome one, and definitely takes some of the pressure off of the rest of my week - plus I know that at the end of next week I'm going to get to carb-load, which I'm also very much looking forward to.

And then of course it'll be the race itself, but anticipation of that is worth a whole other blog post in of itself.
