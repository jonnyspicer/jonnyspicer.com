As part of saying that [I wanted to spend a lot more time playing videogames](/blog/i-want-to-spend-a-lot-more-time-playing-video-games/) I said I wanted to play Sable, and this weekend I got to spend a good 10 hours doing just that. It was everything I wanted it to be;
beautiful, moving, relaxing, and above all, an escape. The world is quirky and unique, the protagonist leaves plenty of room for projection, the soundtrack is luscious and overall, the Sable experience has been a great one so far. I'm glad I have carved out some more time
to play games, just like I wanted.
