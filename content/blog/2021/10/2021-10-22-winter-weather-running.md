It's already getting cold, and winter is coming. A couple of weeks ago I could still enjoy running in 20 degrees, but now it looks like I'll be running in single digits for the foreseeable future. Weirdly, despite really not liking being cold, I do quite like running in
the cold weather - it's nice to feel warm and cosy inside the extra layers, and because fewer people are willing to brave the elements, I'll have more of wherever it is I might be running to myself. After it being mandatory kit for previous races, I now have a fancy
waterproof running jacket and last night I tried another piece of cold weather clothing for the first time - tights.

Honestly, they were a revelation.
