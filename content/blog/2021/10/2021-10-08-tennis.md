Another short one today as I am mired in work, flat viewings, and having to prepare for a friend coming to stay over the weekend. I'm trying to take a brief break from taking running and climbing so seriously, and want to try some new sports while I have slightly more
time, especially ones which might prove to be stress-busting. It's entirely the wrong season for it, but this week I took myself to Decathlon to buy their finest beginner's tennis racket, and will be playing on Monday when I will inevitably have my ego taken down multiple
notches. I think I played once in Mexico, and before then I'm not sure I've played since primary school, but I am excited to have another fun thing to do outside, and am going to try to enjoy being bad as much as I can.
