The skin on my face is usually blotchy, dry and red. I think it's largely psychosomatic, and it's been pretty constant since I've been in London, which I guess is a sign that the city takes its toll and I need to find a way to slow down. I think it'd be good for my mental
health to try and have some kind of skincare routine in order to improve it though; not only would I be happier to look at my face in the mirror, but the ritual of it would be a twice-daily act of self care. As with all these things though, the easy bit is starting and
the hard part is sticking with it, which I have yet to figure - advice and ideas welcome.
