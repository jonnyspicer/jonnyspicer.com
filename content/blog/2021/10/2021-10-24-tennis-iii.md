On Friday I had another stab at playing tennis. The first time I played, I didn't try and serve overarm at all, assuming I would have a 0% success rate and it'd be a waste of time. This time, it turned out that I *can* basically serve, and I probably have a circa 60%
success rate, which I'm chuffed to bits with. I am very keen to continue being bad at tennis, and to enjoy it as much as possible without a focus on either winning or improving and simply playing for the sake of it, but being able to consistently at least start a rally
did make the whole thing even more enjoyable than the first time round.
