The good news is that I am not writing today's blog while absolutely smashed, unlike yesterday's. Personally I'm quite impressed at how well I can still type even while that inebriated.

Anyway, in truly amazing news, the apprentice who I mentor found out today that they are being permanently hired as an associate software engineer. They worked unbelievably hard for it and could not deserve it more, and I feel not only incredibly proud of them but also
vindicated in my own decision to have invested to much time, effort, and indeed emotion into them over the past 9 months. It's a great feeling to have.
