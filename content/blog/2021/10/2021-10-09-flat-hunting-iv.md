After an incredibly intense few days of emails, phone calls, viewings and general stress, I have had an offer accepted on a lovely flat in Oval. It is *very* expensive, and I am quite worried I am making a huge financial blunder, but it was appreciably close to perfect,
and I am telling myself that having a serene environment is a big component of being mentally healthy. It's modern, well furnished and decorated, well-connected, and near enough a climbing wall and the floating centre, 30 minutes from the office, and all in all, I think
it's going to be a big improvement on my current situation.

It is a huge relief to have it sorted, at least on paper. I know there will be a lot more stress when it comes to moving, but again, I know that it will be more than worth it once the ordeal is over. Now I just need to audit my finances and work out how I'm going to be
able to wean myself off expensive takeaways...
