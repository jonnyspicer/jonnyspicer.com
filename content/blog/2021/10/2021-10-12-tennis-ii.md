As promised, yesterday evening I got to put my shiny new racket to the test and play some tennis. In the end I was comedically bad, with their being two options for each shot: hit the ball straight into the bottom of the net, or hit the ball into the top of the fence
behind the court. My underarm serving percentage was less than 25, and if I participated in a rally that lasted more than 5 shots, that was a miracle.

With that being said, I absolutely loved it. It was nice to be bad at something, and not care, and do something for the fun of it, particularly with someone I really enjoy spending time with. I'm already itching to play again.
