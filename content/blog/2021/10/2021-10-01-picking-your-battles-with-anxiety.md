I've been thinking about anxiety a lot recently, as I've noticed that I've stopped pushing my boundaries with it now I am a bit more settled in to London. There are still plenty of things it stops me doing though, and I feel like now I am more in a routine, it flares up
more when anything disrupts that routine.

I am also just really sick of it. It has an attritional quality that grinds you down over years and years, and I just want it to stop. I want to be "normal", even though I know that that means nothing, and is also a waste of my energy to wish for. I'm sure it's never going
to go away, but I am still hopeful that I can get better at managing it, and it's something I want to have a plan to actively work on in the next few months. One of the things that I think I already do reasonably well when it comes to anxiety is picking my battles,
something I learned to do at some point amidst all the therapy sessions I've had over the years. There are a lot of small things that aren't worth the anxiety - eg getting lunch from somewhere different, where I'd have to talk to a real human being, vs buying it from
somewhere with a self checkout. Conversely there are lots of small things that *are* worth it - like striking up a conversation with someone new at the running club or climbing gym. The same obviously applies to big things - if you have a lot of anxiety about it, make
sure that it's *really worth doing*. And if it is, if you've saved up a bunch of emotional energy from not doing all of the small-anxiety-things, then you can usually close your eyes, grit your teeth and get through the big, important stuff. Just make sure that once
you've decided that you definitely *are* going to it, you act as soon as possible, to prevent the overthinking setting in.
