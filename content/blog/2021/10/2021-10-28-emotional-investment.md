Full disclosure; I have had quite a few drinks before writing this one, and I have only 30 or so minutes before my time runs out and I would be losing the bet. That being said, today has been an interesting day emotionally; following on from yesterday's tumultuousness,
today I am waiting to hear about somebody else's good news, or lack thereof. I have realised that I am in fact far more emotionally involved in there outcome than I would be my own, and that is overall a good think I think; it is nice to care about others more than onself.
I am fairly sure I know what the outcome but still, I am far more invested in this than I would be were it my own fate that hung in the balance; so good luck us, I am hoping that my own run good can benefit someone else who I care about for once.
