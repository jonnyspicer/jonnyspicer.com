As I'm now in my penultimate month in Guernsey, I'm trying to make the most of it while I have the opportunity. Obviously it's made slightly more difficult because of the lockdown,
especially as a lot of the things I am going to miss are in fact people. But I can still go outside, and I think the scenery here is really what I am going to miss the most. In the
last year I've become enamoured with the coast & cliffs of the island, but I've spent most of my life not appreciating it at all, and now I feel foolish for it. One of my priorities
while I'm still here is to spend as much time breathing in the fresh sea air as possible.
