It's the Olympic opening ceremony today, and the whole world will be watching. In many ways it doesn't seem like we're collectively quite ready for an event of this scale, and there have already been a huge number of concessions made due to the still ongoing pandemic, but the Games is meant to be a symbol of international hope, and we need that now more than ever. If things go well and
Japan can produce something that at least vaguely resembles a "normal" Olympics, then it could herald the beginning on the end of the pandemic for developed countries, although the developing world invariably still has a long way to go. If it can't, it looks like we might all be in for another difficult winter.

There's a lot of events I am excited to watch; Ingebrigtsen v Cheptegei in the 5000m, Kipchoge v the world in the marathon, and sport climbing's inaugural games. The time zone isn't ideal and my sleep schedule is going to suffer, but hopefully it'll be worth it for the inspiration offered up by the world's best athletes.
