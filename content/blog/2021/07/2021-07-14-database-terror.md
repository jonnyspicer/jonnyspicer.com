I know that databases are incredibly boring to most people, and most of the time they're perfectly uninteresting to me as well. Everyone knows that if you're
feeling sluggish and sleepy first thing in the morning, the easiest way to feel alert and attentive is to drop a production table, and this week I am really
starting to understand why. I have to upgrade in-place a production DB that powers a decent chunk of our business, and am doing various bits of production
database administration in preparation for it, and the whole thing is... abjectly terrifying.

Who said software engineering can't come with a healthy dose of adrenaline?
