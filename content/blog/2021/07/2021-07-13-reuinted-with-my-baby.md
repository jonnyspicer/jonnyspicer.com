Today my PC arrived at my flat, after being couriered across the English Channel by one of my friends. At the moment I have no monitor so it's not much use,
but it feels good to have it back by my side. It's something that I built myself, have tweaked, upgraded and fixed over the years, and have invested a lot
of money, energy and obviously time into. Perhaps not all that time was wisely spent, but there aren't many other items that have had that I've had for a
long time, they've changed along the way but remain unmistakeably the thing I loved when I first got it. I wouldn't have got my current job without it, and
without my job I wouldn't be in London, and without being in London I don't think I'd be as happy as I am.

I am very excited to buy a 4K monitor and a new mechanical keyboard that is inevitably going to cost far too much money, and then boot it up once again,
