A couple of weekends ago, an old friend and I went through the ["36 questions to fall in love"](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/style/no-37-big-wedding-or-small.html) that I presume I have mentioned on here before. Given that she's engaged, actually falling in love wasn't really an option,
and having known each other for 15 or so years now, we could guess at each other's answers pretty well. But still, there were some interesting insights to be
had, and I gained a lot from the evening we spent opening up to one another.

In the time since, I've reflected on a few of our answers and there are a couple that I thought were interesting. The twelfth question is "if you could wake
up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?", and it took me a while to come up with an answer, before a slightly depressing one
struck - the ability to switch off all conscious thought. As far as I can tell, some people seem to be able to get alarmingly close to being able to do this,
and I'm filled with jealousy. It's also something that *I* could theoretically get close to, with enough meditation.

I really think I would be so, so, *so* much happier if I could do this. Perhaps I am going to have to go on a meditation retreat sometime soon.
