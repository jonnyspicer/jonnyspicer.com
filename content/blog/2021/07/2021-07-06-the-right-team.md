In my new job I have come to appreciate that the idea of culture fit/personality over skills in terms of putting a team together is the absolute truth. The
team I currently work with make the good days genuinely enjoyable and the hard days bearable. The feeling of both camaraderie and psychological safety
afforded to me by working with them makes a *huge* difference to how I feel about work, and likely makes a significant difference to my productivity and the
quality of my output as well. Today I am especially grateful for my teammates.
