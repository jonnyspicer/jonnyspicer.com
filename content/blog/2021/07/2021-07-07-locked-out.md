Today I locked myself out of my flat, which was bound to happen at some point. I didn't sleep well, was distracted in the morning and simply walked out
the door with my keys still on the kitchen table. I was in fact so distracted that I didn't even notice until lunchtime.

Fortunately the lettings agent had a spare set, so it was easy enough to get back in. Previously I might've really struggled with something like that, even
though as I type it out now it seems embarrassingly trivial - I just get really overwhelmed by small things going wrong sometimes. But not today, I managed
to cap it at mild annoyance, and that seems like another good marker of progress.
