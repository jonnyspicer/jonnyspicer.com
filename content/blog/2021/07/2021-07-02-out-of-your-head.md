I have some of the notes that my previous therapist made up on my fridge, the idea being that I can not only refer to them easily whenever I want, but also
that I will see them often enough to hopefully start to internalise them a little more (let's face it; I am opening my fridge plenty). One of my favourite
things scrawled on the slightly chaotic A3 piece of paper is "get out of your head and into your life", which is reminiscent of Shawshank's famous "get busy
living or get busy dying" soundbite.

As she correctly identified I spend way, way more time than is healthy inside my own head, often at the expense of enjoying whatever is going on around me.
Fortunately in London it seems easier to focus on the "get into your life" bit, as it feels like there's a lot of life to get into. So that's what's been on
my mind recently; how I would like to think less and do more. I've never been successful at doing that, but I think I've made an iota of progress in the past
couple of months, so hopefully it'll continue.
