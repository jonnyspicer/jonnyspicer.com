Yesterday I went back to Leicester Square for the first time in a long time - roughly 5 years in fact. The last time I went there it was to play in a 1k in the Hippodrome, back when I was a "professional" gambler. Going back there again felt funny, as all the feelings
I had previously associated with it came flooding back - the excitement, the anxiety, the amazement that I was really doing what I was doing. Five years ago was a long time, but I feel like a completely different person now to who I was then, with my life on a completely
different track; it's a whole new life altogether.

It was a very strange feeling, but one I quite liked, I preferred the feelings I felt this time to the ones last time. I do want to go back to the casino soon though...
