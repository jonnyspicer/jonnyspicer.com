As part of going to Leicester Square, I visited the M&M shop there. It is one of the most ridiculous places I've ever been. It's *so* big - there are three floors and an extra mezzanine, all devoted to M&Ms, and each floor is expansive. It boasts what is allegedly "the
largest chocolate wall in the world". The smell, clearly pumped through the ventilation system, is overwhelming, and after 10 minutes I couldn't really stand it any more. There must be literally *millions* of M&Ms in there, accompanied my mugs, t-shirts, cuhsions, and
pretty much anything else you could think of with a large, encircled "M" on. There are person-sized Ms with eyes and limbs.

I get that it's mostly a tourist attraction and that I am overthinking it, but still. It was quite the experience, and I'm amazed somewhere like that exists.
