I locked myself out of my flat again, for the second time in three weeks. Having to sheepishly get the keys off my estate agent again was extremely embarrassing, and I am still reeling from it.

It has left me spending the rest of the day stuck with the question, "why am I like this?", sadly without a satisfactory answer to go with it.
