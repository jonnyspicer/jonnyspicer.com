There's just two more days until "Freedom Day", when all national COVID restrictions in England are set to be lifted. As I am now in the capital for the
first time during a massive spike in cases, it's hard to feel particularly good about the prospect of positive tests continuing their upward trend, and
Monday's moniker feels premature. For the first time, someone I care about has had the virus and has experienced scary symptoms because of it, and I feel
myself becoming more cautious, rather than more relaxed.

The whole thing feels like a gamble, and usually I love gambling, but not when the stakes are this high. Hopefully the powers at be know better than I do.
