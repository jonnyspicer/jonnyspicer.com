While speaking to Ted the other day, we were talking about people that have all the necessary resources to be happy, but for some reason aren't. I'm
definitely one of those people, and I think in the time since we talked about it, I've been doing my best to pinch myself every so often and say "hey, you,
be happy!" and to some extent it seems to be working. Maybe the next step is to do one of those lucid dreaming things where you draw dots on the back of your
hand, except instead of knowing I'm awake whenever I look at them, I'll take it as a reminder to be happy.

Or maybe I could get some kind of suitable tattoo instead...
