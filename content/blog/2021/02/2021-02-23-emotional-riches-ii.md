While lamenting the constant exhaustion of my "emotionally rich" life [barely over a month ago,](/blog/emotional-riches) I am pleased to say I've
done a pretty good job of swapping for something more emotionally bland recently, and I'm loving it. Obviously the pandemic helps, every day is largely the same, and having a new job
with good work-life balance as well as clear expectations of me makes things simple. I've been socialising a lot, and actually really enjoying spending more of my energy on myself -
perhaps I am even more introverted than previously thought.

As I suspected in my previous past, the consistency is wonderful. I'm not euphoric every day (in a way which might balance out my tendency to be despondent every day), but I'm content,
and it's peaceful. What I might have once considered boring is actually exactly what I wanted.
