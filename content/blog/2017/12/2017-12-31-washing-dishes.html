title: Washing the dishes
---

<span >I have historically underrated washing the dishes. It's relaxing and easy, you get the feeling of productivity very cheaply. You can be mindful or you can put on some music and sing along. I only hope one day I will be able to wash the dishes well enough to meet Ted and Mica's stratospheric standards of crockery cleanliness.&nbsp;</span>
