title: Failure vs regret
---

<span >I am constantly scared of failure, even if I know it is irrational. I find it very easy to be consumed by this fear of failure, and often find myself feeling down when small things go wrong. But I know that the real fear should be of regret, as the pain of regret is far worse than the pain of failure. While I worry day to day about whether or not I will try and fail, I ought to remember that to not try at all would be disastrous.&nbsp;</span>
