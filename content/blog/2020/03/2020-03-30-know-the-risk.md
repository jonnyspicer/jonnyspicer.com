title: Know the Risk
---
One of the best pieces of advice that I have heard with regard to dealing with the current pandemic
is to know the risk - to educate yourself on what, specifically, is the risk to yourself, your family
and your friends. Doing so means you'll panic less, and can form actionable steps to take towards
protecting yourself and those close to you. Knowledge will breed peace of mind, and cutting through
the noise is easier than I had first thought, once I actually applied myself to the task and asked
some friends for help.
