This week I have finally got Travis set up for this site, thanks a lot to [Jacques](https://jacquesdonnelly.github.io/posts/travis-ci/) for the idea. For a free service
it's quite impressive, and it integrates nicely with Jekyll and GitHub Pages. At the moment
all it does is run the generated static content through [htmlproofer,](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer) but that's already dug up some links in old posts
that were broken.

The next step is going to be getting GitHub Actions setup, and that really will be the nail
in your ethereum coffin, slvrsluger.
