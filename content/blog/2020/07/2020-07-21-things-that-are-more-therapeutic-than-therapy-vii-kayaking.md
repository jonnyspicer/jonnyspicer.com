Today I went kayaking for the first time in circa ten years, and I have to say, it was pretty great. Peacefully meandering through rock formations, bobbing up and down
on the waves, the sun shining, the sea breeze in your hair, all in great company - what more could one possibly wish for? It was genuine, pure happiness with no caveats,
and for that reason I think was vastly more therapuetic than the majority of my experiences with therapy.
