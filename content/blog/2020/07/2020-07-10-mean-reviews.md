title: Mean Reviews

Yesterday I discovered a new guilty pleasure, and one which I strongly suspect will stick; reading mean reviews. It all started [here,](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6398634-the-happiness-project) more specifically with this wonderful
[single-star review.](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/182139162?book_show_action=true) There is something wonderfully comforting about reading someone's take on
another's perceived failure - particularly when you suspect they are making salient points. I
also think the irony of a bad review having more literary legitimacy than it opines the book
itself to have is particularly delicious. Perhaps in the future I will try and feature some
of my favourite mean book reviews - I am quietly confident there will be some delightful
ones for Infinite Jest, for example.
