title: "Things I Hate: Yachts"
---
I really hate yachts. They are the embodiment of the evils of
capitalism. The tangible representation of "fuck you money". To
own a yacht is simply to have too much personal wealth, and
to refuse to use your excess to help others who could leverage
it better than you. Nobody *needs* a yacht - imagine if we just
liquidated every yacht in the world and reallocated the money
into public education and healthcare. We'd probably solve every
major issue currently facing global society. But instead, the
ultra wealthy get to cruise along the high seas, sipping
champagne, their days of honest labour long behind them (if they
ever existed to begin with), completely oblivious to the
struggles of the people who don't own yachts. Anyway, the point
is - I really hate yachts.
