Recently the question was posed as to whether if one were to abstain from cake for 100 days, would the cake on the 101st day taste so good as to counteract all
the pain from witholding cake from oneself for the previous days. I posited that no, there was no way - 100 days of consciously restricting yourself takes a big toll,
and while cake is good, its not transcendent.

Today I went back to my favourite Thai place in Guernsey, Bao, after more than 100 days without it. Was it good? It was amazing, still just as perfect as before lockdown,
everything I'd hoped it would be. Did it make up for 100 days without it? Absolutely not.
