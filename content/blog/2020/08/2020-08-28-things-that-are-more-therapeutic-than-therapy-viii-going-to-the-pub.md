Going to the pub is a stable of the British social diet, and while this obviously comes with some caveats, I think going to the pub with your mates is immensely therapeutic. It's a
perfect chance to enjoy being in the company of others, with alcohol potentially removing some amount of social friction - you can have some of the best DMCs in the pub and also become
friends with strangers in a way that you can't in other locales. It's rarely awkward, the vibes are good, and if you're really lucky, there's even a log fire. There's just something
immensely *comfortable* about the whole pub atmosphere, and I think that's a wonderful thing for one's mental health.
