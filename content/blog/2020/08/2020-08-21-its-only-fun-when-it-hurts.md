title: It's Only Fun When It Hurts
---
I think I am a favourite to one day get the words "no gamble, no future" tattooed somewhere on my body. While I don't
really play much poker any more, some of the sayings were pretty neat, and as we all know by now, the game is wonderfully
analogous to life.

While I love "no gamble, no future", one of the other phrases I heard in poker, I believe from Lex Veldhuis (possibly
on an episode of the Poker Life Podcast?) is that "it's only fun when it hurts", of course referring to poker or perhaps
gambling in general. I seem to find a lot of applications for the saying off the virtual felt, too.
