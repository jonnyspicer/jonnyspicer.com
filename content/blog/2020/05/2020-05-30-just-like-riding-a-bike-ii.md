Today saw my second cycling lesson with a friend, where this time we ventured out onto the roads! Or at least, sort of, they were still lanes but fairly busy with cars. It's
still terrifying, and I was clutching the handlebars as hard as possible the whole time, but I at least think I have the mechanical aspect of riding a bike down. All that is left
is to keep facing my fears and build up my confidence over time - it seems like a valuable exercise to practice relaxing both mind and body.
