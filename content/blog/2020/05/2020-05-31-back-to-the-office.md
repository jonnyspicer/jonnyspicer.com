title: Back to the Office
---
Tomorrow is going to be my first day back in the office in almost three months. There are going to be new rules to be adhered to, new distances to be kept, a new normal, but I am
hoping that being able to spend my time working in a room with other people rather than on my own will be an experience that I have a newfound gratitude for. It feels like a back
step in the return to how life used to be pre-pandemic, a process that in general I am both hopeful and hesitant towards.

The free coffee will be nice though, even if my coworkers and I will all have to make our own.
