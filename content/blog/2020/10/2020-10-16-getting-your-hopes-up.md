title: Getting Your Hopes Up
---
I try really, really hard not to get my hopes up, about pretty much anything that I want. Obviously the more I want it, the more I try to emotionally hedge against future
disappointment. Today my therapist pointed out that while I was anxiously awaiting some important news, sometimes it's just not possible to consciously lower your expectations.
Disappointment is natural, sometimes helpful, and sometimes inevitable.

Anyway, this thing that I'd tried so hard to not get my hopes up about and failed - the news was good. Time to go celebrate.
