Another short one today because I am exhausted and am about to try to squeeze in a nap before I head out to a quiz tonight - napping not being something I do often at all. Before I go
I would like to offer you all some pure conjecture thoughl my intuition is that there is a strong correlation between regularity of naps in adults and their overall happiness &
wellbeing.

Or maybe there isn't. What do I know?
