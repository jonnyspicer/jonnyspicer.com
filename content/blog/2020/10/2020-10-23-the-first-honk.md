I avoid confrontation like the plague. I'm the kind of person who apologises if someone steps on my foot.

I've also been driving for almost 8 years now, and as far as I'm aware, I've never honked anyone. Until yesterday.

Maybe that's who I am now. A honker. He-who-honks. But only when they absolutely 100% deserve it, and there's no conceivable way *I* could be in the wrong.
