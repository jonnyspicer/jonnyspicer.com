title: Sweating The Odds
---
Over the past couple of weeks, I've got into the habit of checking the odds on the US Presidential Election multiple times a day. It is 100% Ted's fault.

I do quite like it though, and it makes following updates from across the pond a lot more bearable. If I am looking at it all through the lens of being able to bet on it, it becomes
a lot more like a game, and not so much like an alarmingly close race that has the potential to impact the whole world in profound, irreversible ways.
