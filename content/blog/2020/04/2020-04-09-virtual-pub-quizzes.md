title: Virtual Pub Quizzes
---
Last night I took part in my first virtual pub quiz, and soon realised that I know far less than I thought I did. At least
about famous pubs, children's stories and exotic animals.

Despite having my ego bruised, it was a lot of fun, retaining a lot of the atmosphere of a bona fide pub quiz. Most importantly,
it was a welcome example of the "new normal", and a reassuring moment of connection in the midst of a tumultuous week.
