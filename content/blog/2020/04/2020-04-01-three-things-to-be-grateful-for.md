title: Three Things to be Grateful For
---
Inspired (as always) by Polly, today I wanted to follow her lead and share three things which I am
grateful for, in a time when gratitude seems necessary to remain afloat.

- Being able to talk to her despite the distance between us, to laugh and joke, to try to find silver
linings and to make plans to look forward to, once this is all over;

- Being able to run in the sunshine, to enjoy nature and forget about my worries and the worries of
the world fora while;

- The [Slow Burn podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/slow-burn/id1315040130)
for educating and entertaining me all day, keeping me company while I'm working on my own and contextualising
some of the greatest political scandals in modern history.
