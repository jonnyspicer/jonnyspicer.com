Today I am exceptionally grateful for takeaways, and other people's cooking in general. I have tried my post over the
lockdown period, but it just hasn't cut it, and something prepared by someone else is not only less emotionally draining
but also seeems to taste better for it. Sure, it's probably terrible for me, but when it's this delicious, who cares?
