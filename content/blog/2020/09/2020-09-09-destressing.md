title: Destressing

Today I am very stressed, and with a couple of hours left before bedtime I am trying to work out how best to ease this mental tension. Being able to destress effectively and efficiently
seems like a valuable skill to have in the modern age, and one that has been commodified heavily, but it's still not something that comes easily or seems intuitive to me.

My ideas to try are;

- Play games
- Watch Netflix
- Read
- Meditate
- All of the above.
