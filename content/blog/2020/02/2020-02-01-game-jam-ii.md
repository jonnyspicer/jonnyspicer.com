This year I am once again participating in the [Global Game Jam](/blog/game-jam), and after approximately 28 of our allotted 48 hours, we have already produced
something leaps and bounds ahead of last year's effort. It has been frankly exhausting, but this time I can say that I'm genuinely proud of the work that myself and our team
have done and what we've been able to make in such a short period of time.

Tomorrow our game will theoretically be available to play on the internet, so I'll post a link and write a little more about it after the event is over.
