title: Lunch && Code

Today saw the reincarnation of Guernsey techie meetup Lunch && Code, sponsored by the wonderful
company that employs yours truly. I have always felt a little uncomfortable at these kinds of events previously (perhaps this is
the case for the majority of attendees, given their nature as software-type-people and their propensity for having poor social
skills), but today I'm pleased to report I felt a lot more at home amongst their number. In part I think it is partially an easing
of my anxiety in general (as discussed [recently](/blog/say-yes)) and in part because I have formed connections
of some description with enough of the regulars that I can overcome some amount of initial awkwardness. My entire "professional"
life I have struggled hugely with networking, habitually being struck by overwhelming nerves to the extent I've abhored and avoided
the practice for years. Today though, I actually managed to have a couple of fairly reasonable conversations that could possibly
be described as at least networking-adjacent... Progress?
