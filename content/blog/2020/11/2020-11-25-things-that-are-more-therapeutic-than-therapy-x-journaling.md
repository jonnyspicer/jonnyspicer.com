title: "Things That Are More Therapeutic Than Therapy X: Journaling"
series: ["Things That Are More Therapeutic Than Therapy"]
---
Thoughts always seem so different when written down compared to when they're bouncing around in my brain, and while I write here every day, there's plenty that I won't write about in
public, including the juiciest bits. So in the journal they go. I try and write in it every day, but I rarely manage, and sometimes if I haven't penned an entry in 3 or 4 days, once
I finally do it feels like a palpable weight off my shoulders (incidentally today was one of those days). I think there's so much catharsis to be found, so much perspective to be
gained, such an act of self-care to be made by journaling. Which sounds like everything one might want out of therapy to me.
