title: "Things That Are More Therapeutic Than Therapy IX: Podcasts"
series: ["Things That Are More Therapeutic Than Therapy"]

I have a *lot* of free time on my hands at the moment, and pretty much all my friends are working during the day, so a large proportion of that free time is spent on my own. I am
pretty terrified of my own thoughts, so having to spend so much time without any social interaction to slow the introspective death spiral has been a bit of a challenge. The only
thing keeping me sane (a phrase I use with only a light sprinkling of hyperbola) is a slew of podcasts about comedy, culture, politics, history, technology, mental health... really
anything I can get my hands on. Using podcasts as a form of self-medication like this is an idea I've shamelessly stolen, but it's definitely a winner.
