A quick one this evening as I haven't given myself enough time to write a meaningful blog and I'm already late for my engagement for the evening. This week I played through [Manifold Garden,](https://manifold.garden/) a beautiful Escheresque indie first person puzzler, and really enjoyed it. The game has no overt storyline, but there is a vague
sense of the protagonist cleansing the world around them as you move through the puzzles, and the mechanics were pretty enjoyable, plus the game is visually beautiful. Sits somewhere
in between The Spectrum Retreat and Antichamber on my FPP tier list, 7.5/10.
