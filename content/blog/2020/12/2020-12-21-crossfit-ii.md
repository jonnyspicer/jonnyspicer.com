I don't want to be one of those people who starts doing Crossfit and then only ever talks about how great Crossfit is, because that's insufferable and I know I'm already insufferable
about a million other things as it is. With that being said, today was my second session, and I realised one of the great appeals of Crossfit; escapism, just like video games
yesterday. There's all kinds of fairly pretentious marketing spiel about "leaving everything else at the door" but when I'd finished, I realised I had, I'd inadvertently not thought
about anything else in my life for the whole hour. That's not something I feel like very often, and in of itself is enough to keep me going back to Crossfit.
