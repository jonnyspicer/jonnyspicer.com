title: Tired All The Time
---
I feel like I have written this exact blog post before, but it is another evening when I am too tired to think of anything else, and I've been tired all day. I had a good night's
sleep, I went out for a run this morning, I've eaten fruit and vegetables, what gives? I can't help but feel my whole life would be much better if I could make it through a whole
day without telling somebody I was tired.
