Last year I didn't write about resolutions, but I still feel pretty much the same as I did [two years ago.](/blog/new-years-resolutions) People who
hate on resolutions are cynics, and I'm still trying not to be one. I managed another whole year without killing myself, although sadly I weigh pretty much the same, am decidedly
un-jacked, my self esteem is still... not so good... but at least I am a little closer to a lot of the people around me. Oh, and I didn't [read Infinite Jest.](/blog/can-jonny-actually-read-challenge-2.0)

My resolutions this year are admittedly a bit predictable, but I'm going to just say that I'm being perseverant; don't kill myself, lose weight & get jacked, improve self esteem
wholly unconnected to my body, and read 12 books in a the year, none of which are by David Foster Wallace. Fingers crossed I can pull them all off.
