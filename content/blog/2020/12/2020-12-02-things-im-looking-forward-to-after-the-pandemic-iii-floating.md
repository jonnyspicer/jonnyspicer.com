title: "Things I'm Looking Forward To After The Pandemic III: Floating"
series: ["Things I'm Looking Forward To After The Pandemic"]

It's been a whole year since I've been able to lock myself in a dark, quiet box filled with very salty water and I am missing it very much. It's one of the things I am most looking
forward to about moving to London, being able to get a membership and go floating regularly, and I'm sure I'm one of many who miss being able to spend time in the most peaceful
place I've found. Whenever I finally manage to get off this island, the tank is the first place I'm gonna head.
