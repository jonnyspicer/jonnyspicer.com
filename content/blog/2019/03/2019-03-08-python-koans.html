title: Python Koans
---
<p>
  Continuing on my journey to learn Python, this weekend I am going to try to
  smash through as many of these wonderful <a href="https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">
  Python Koans</a> as possible. I'll report back on Sunday evening with whether
  or not I gained any deep insight into either Python or the nature of human
  consciousness.
