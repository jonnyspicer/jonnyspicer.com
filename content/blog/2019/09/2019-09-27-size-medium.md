title: Size Medium
---
After years of buying size large shirts, I decided to optimistically get a medium off the
internet, where I wouldn't be able to try it on. I've lost a tiny amount of weight recently,
nothing exciting, but enough to be a little hopeful that it'd fit, and I figured if not, it'd
be extra motivation to keep going. It arrived yesterday, and it fits. What a relief.
