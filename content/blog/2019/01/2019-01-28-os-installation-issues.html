  I'm moving out tomorrow, and in preparation for doing so, I'm attempting to overwrite
  my Kali install with an Ubuntu one on my desktop. It turns out this is not as
  simple as I had hoped, and is in fact quite frustrating - firstly, as I had
  filled the drive with junk data during my Kali install, there was no space
  for Ubuntu, so I had to boot back into Windows and wipe the drive. Now, I have a
  bootloader install failed error, for unknown reasons. I guess I am going to try
  and manually install a bootloader, wish me luck...
