<p>
  Today I learned a new word, courtesy of <a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20190201" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
  apenwarr,</a> and that word is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
  satisficing.</a> I think it's my new favourite.
</p>
<p>
  The basic idea is that satisficing (satisfying and sufficing) is when you
  make a choice based on something meeting some lower bound of acceptability,
  rather than prolonging the decision making process in order to find the most
  optimal choice. And I think this idea encapsulates everything I am terrified
  of in my life.
</p>
<p>
  I am terrified of satisficing on (I have no idea what the right preposition to
  use is) a girlfriend or serious relationship. I am terrified of satisficing
  on a job or a career path. I am terrified of satisficing on a place to live,
  and not trying to leave Guernsey, and regretting it. I am terrified of
  satisficing on myself, and not pushing myself to improve further.
</p>
<p>
  So, from now on: <strong>no satisficing.</strong>
