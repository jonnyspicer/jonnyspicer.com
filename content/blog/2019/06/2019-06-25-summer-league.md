The Guernsey Chess Club's summer league has officially started, and has made me realise quite how much fun the game can be. In the absence
of any kind of pressure to get results (other than that applied by my own ego) I am free to play spuriously, speculatively and hopefully spectacularly,
knowing that one particularly thrilling victory will more than make up for a handful of underwhelming losses.

The question is, when we revert back to the winter league and things get all serious, which one way would I rather be playing?
