title: Catching Myself Being Happy
---
One of the huge upsides to being very depressed for a very long time is that when I'm not, it's a constant and pleasant surprise.
Having previously lamented that my lifetime net emotion is very far in the red, I am enjoying the variance finally evening out a little,
and periodically noticing that I am actually happy - and that happiness is retaining its novelty - is a great feeling. Meta-happiness
is something I'd highly recommend.
