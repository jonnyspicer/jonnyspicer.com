I don't know if I've ever mentioned, but I hate Valentine's Day. Despite having a partner this year, I still think it's awful; it's a way of commercialising romance and relationships for profit (and those things are expensive enough as it is), and rampant smugness
of individuals and corporate marketing campaigns contributes to millions of lonely people's misery. Even if I might not be so bitter at my current situation this time round, I'm still bitter for my past situations, and can't see myself forgiving Valentine's Day
any time soon - and I don't think you should either.
