The swelling in my left leg has *finally* reduced down to virtually nothing, and so this evening I was able to head out on my first run in 10 days. While I'd hoped that my legs would feel amazing and I'd simply glide along the banks of the River Thames, obviously that did not happen - after a week and
a half of being entirely sedentary, my muscles and joints had quickly become unaccustomed to the repeated impacts of jogging and made their displeasure known to my nervous system. Still, I wasn't going to let this minor complaint diminish my enjoyment of something I'd been looking forward to, and it
felt like a huge relief more than anything, to be out of my flat, able to keep working on the cornerstone of my mental and physical health again after what felt like an eternity of inactivity.
