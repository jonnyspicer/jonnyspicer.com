I am once again struggling to prioritise what feels like a very limited amount of time. I am trying to overhaul my use of productivity apps and amalgamate everything into [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) (which I've discovered is a lot more powerful than I previously realised), complete the 80000 Hours
career plan which requires a huge amount of research and reading, get back into full-on ultramarathon training, make progress towards my [yearly goals](/100-hours) and invest time and energy into my relationship with my partner. It's a lot, and that's just today.

Much like the most effective way to learn something starts with learning how to learn effectively, I wonder if it is possible to learn strategies to prioritise things effectively. When I get round to having the time to find out, I'll share any findings I have here.
