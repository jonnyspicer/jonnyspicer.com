I've been having a lot of fun with [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) recently. I may be bandwagonning on the latest craze, but I think the game is a lot of fun, as well as a great example of how effective a simple side project for a developer can be
(apparently he made it for his girlfriend, how sweet is that?). The competitive aspect of trying to do better than everyone at work in our #wordle-wars slack channel is the primary allure but for anyone that loves word puzzles and hasn't checked it out, I would
highly recommend they do so.
