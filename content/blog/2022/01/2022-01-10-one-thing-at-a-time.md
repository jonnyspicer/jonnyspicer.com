I am doing it again. And by *it*, I mean splitting my attention too many ways, assuming I can make meaningful progress in several areas of my life simultaneously, and generally overcomplicating my life. It's a cycle I seem to get in where I keep doing this until I burn out and start everything all over
again from scratch, but hopefully now I have enough awareness of the problem that I can nip it in the bud.

Anyway this blog post is really just me trying to convince myself I don't have time to join a chess club.
