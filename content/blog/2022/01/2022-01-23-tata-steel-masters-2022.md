Round eight of this year's edition of the Tata Steel Masters in Wijk an Zee, Netherlands is just about wrapping up, and so far this
tournament has already had its fair share of thrills and spills. Last year's surprise winner, Jorden Van Foreest has played six decisive
games, something virtually unheard of at this level, Fabiano Caruana one-move blundered an entire rook to Anish Giri, something similarly
unfathomable in elite chess, and Daniil Dubov has forfeited a game for refusing to wear a mask in his game against Giri after being in
close contact with a covid case but testing negative himself. The games themselves have also been immensely entertaining with the players
seemingly excited to try out some of the more dubious lines in their opening repertoires - Shakhriyar Mamedyarov went for the particularly
memorable 1.d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g4?! with white against Andrey Esipenko, Daniil Dubov attempted to up the volume in the so-called "Giucco
Piano" with the optimistic 8. Na3, and Van Foreest showed that some "bad" lines might not be as bad as they really seem, beating Indian
youngster Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa with the speculative 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4?!. After having recently complained about the low standards
of chess commentary, I have been really impressed with the pairing of Fiona Steil-Antoni and Robert Hess and have enjoyed actually not
having to mute the broadcast in order to enjoy it.

It almost makes me want to play in a chess tournament myself...
