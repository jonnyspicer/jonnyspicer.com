Today was my first day heading back to the office in about two months, and it did feel very enjoyable to have a change of scenery. The
building is, for some reason, freezing cold, so it was a good job that I ran in in order to warm up - although this turned out to be quite
a bit more difficult with a heavy back than I'd hoped for. Still, my boss paid for lunch and I got to be surrounded by the gentle buzz of
productivity that can only cajole me into working hard, so I'm already quite excited to go back next week.
