Today the lottery opens for the legendary [UTMB,](https://utmbmontblanc.com/) perhaps the most famous ultramarathon in the world. I'm
obviously not up to the task of an alpine 100-miler just yet, but fortunately there's an "easy" option, consisting of a mere 55km with
only 3000m of gain. The race, the OCC, starts in Orsi√®res, Switzerland, before hoping the border and finishing in Chamonix, France, all
under the shadow of the iconic Mont Blanc. It's only a little over a month after the EUT, but given I worked so hard to get the
qualifying points for this lottery last autumn, it would've been rude not to enter it. By the 26th I'll know whether or not I've got a
place, and then sometime next month I'll find out whether or not I have a London Marathon place... 2022 could be quite the year for
racing.
