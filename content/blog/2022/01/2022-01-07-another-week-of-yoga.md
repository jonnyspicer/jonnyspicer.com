Today is the 7th of January which means that, as part of my [100 hour goals](/100-hours) for the year, I've done 20-30 minutes of yoga
every day for the past week. After doing it daily for a couple of months during lockdown, my practice quickly slipped to weekly, and then
simply rarely after I moved to London, and I began the week conscious of my tight hips and weak core. The nice thing about starting from
the beginning is that you get to experience beginner gains again, and that's precisely what I've enjoyed this week - the difference to the
amount of tension and discomfort in my lower back in just a week is amazing. I feel noticeably stronger and healthier and far more capable
of sitting at my desk (and by desk I mean kitchen table) for the duration of my working day.

Given that right now, the benefits of a regular yoga practice seem so obvious to me, I don't want to do what I did last time and fall off
the wagon. I think working from home the majority of the time and in my own flat will make this a lot easier, as it's easy to practice on
my lunch break, and with so much of my focus on training for the race, of which yoga is a crucial component, I'm confident it'll be easier
to make this habit stick for more than a few months, even if my practice isn't necessarily daily.
