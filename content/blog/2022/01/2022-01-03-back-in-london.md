As of yesterday I am finally back in London, and it feels like a big relief. Throughout my whole time in Guernsey I experienced a
persistent low level anxiety that made the experience exhausting, and may even have had a physiological effect on me - running comparable
speeds and distances in London my heart rate has been meaningfully lower.

Living on my own and having my own space has made London quickly feel like home, and it is amazing to be able to walk out the door and
not be worried about who I might bump into (or indeed to walk out the door at all, given my recent self isolation). Having the comfort of
my plants, my coffee grinder, and my king size bed are all things that I'll take for granted a little less after having been deprived of
them for two weeks.

I have already been thinking about moving on from London - about getting a remote job and moving to the mountains, or the sea, or simply
travelling round anywhere that'd have me. But as they say, absence makes the heart grow fonder, and upon returning to London I feel more
appreciative of it than I did before I left, and the chaos and frenetic pace of life here feels strangely comforting. It's good to be
back.
