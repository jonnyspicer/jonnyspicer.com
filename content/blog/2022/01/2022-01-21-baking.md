After having finally figured out how to enjoy cooking, and dabbling in some marginally more adventurous kitchen activities like fermenting peppers, pickling cucumbers and making my own hot sauce,
baking seemed like an obvious next step. I've only attempted to bake once since being in London, and it went poorly - I burned a batch of cookies intened for my now-girlfriend's birthday, and so
ended up making a whole second batch of cookie dough and giving that to her in raw format, rather than trying to work with an oven that I'm convinced was broken. Last night I made granola bars off
the Bake Off calendar for January and they turned out deliciously, as well as providing perfect comfort food for another day when I'm exhausted and uninspired to write about anything else.
