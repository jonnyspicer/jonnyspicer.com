Unfortunately I didn't get into the OCC, but in reality I am quite glad - attempting to run another race only slightly more than a month after the EUT would've been pretty stupid, and even if I had got a place, I might not have accepted it anyway. It does make me very tempted to sign up for the
[Ring of Steall](https://www.skylinescotland.com/skyrunning-races/ring-of-steall-skyrace/) in September as that ought to be enough recovery time, but with the new (and confusing) UTMB system for next year I might see if I can squeeze in another race that will give me "Running Stones" instead. With
the new system, if you don't win a place in the lottery then you can carry over your ballot entries to the next year, which suddenly makes the UTMB itself seem an inevitability if I were to do one or two big races a year and keep entering the lotteries for the main event... But we'll have to see how the
EUT goes first.
