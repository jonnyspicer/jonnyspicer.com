Today is my first rest day of the year. Or at least, it sort of is - I already did a fairly difficult yoga session and I did *try* and go
for a run, but after going 200m down the road my legs were having none of it and I decided to try to be sensible about the whole thing. Part
of me is worried about losing momentum by not sticking to what has become a daily habit, but another part of me is quite relieved, knowing
that I am taking quite a lot of risks with my training and my body is *very* tired, so to take some rest because of fatigue rather than
injury is likely a stroke of luck.

With all that being said, I am still very much planning on grinding out another 10 miles tomorrow.
