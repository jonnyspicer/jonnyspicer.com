After almost 10 years of trying, I feel like I'm finally getting the hang of cooking. It turns out that actually what I needed was having a romantic partner and a desire to impress them, as well
as to live in a place where dining out is savagely expensive that if I want delicious Mexican food, I'm going to have to learn how to cook it myself. I've tried all kinds of new recipes, my favourite
being Andrew Rea's [swedish meatballs](https://basicswithbabish.co/basicsepisodes/swedish-meatballs) which is probably my favourite thing I've ever cooked. I've even laid to rest much of the anxiety
I previously had about cooking for other people, so much so that inviting a friend round for dinner is now on the brink of being my preferred method of socialising.

I'm relieved to finally have discovered how to enjoy something that is such a cornerstone of our health. Perhaps this is a big step towards being a legitimate adult?
