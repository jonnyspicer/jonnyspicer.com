Last night I watched [The Big Short](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596363/) and I have to say, it made me feel profoundly sad in a way
that I can't remember another film making me feel. It has a star studded cast and recounts the story of Michael Burry, Steve Eisman,
Grepp Lipman, Ben Hockett, Charles Ledley and Jamie Mai as they bet against the notoriously robust US housing market, "shorting" it in
the form of credit default swaps against tranches of mortgage bonds and collateralised debt obligations. I watched the film and then
looked up half the terms and still only understand half of that sentence, but the point is that it depicts the entirely true story of
a coalition of banks, mortgage brokers, ratings agencies, the SEC and the US government to defraud millions of average American people
out of their pensions, savings, homes and in many cases, lives. It didn't just affect Americans though, as the world economy collapsed
with ramifications for almost everyone I know (or at least their parents), and I'm sure other nations' institutions and governments were
just as culpable as their star-spangled counterparts.

And the worst part? Nothing changed. In less than five years the Dow Jones surpassed its 2007 peak and has continued to soar, with the
global pandemic - which has killed millions and caused millions more to again lose homes and savings - not even setting the industrial
average back a year as it continues to moon. CDOs simply got renamed "Bespoke Tranche Opportunities" or even just "Bespoke CDOs" and
are still sold. I'm obviously not an expert, but as far as I can tell, little has changed in the way of regulation. Some people are
predicting that we're on the brink of an even bigger bubble than 2008 *right now*, and when you take into account the soaring price of
every security ever, the mind-boggling price of crypto (which isn't really anything other than a bunch of hashes) and, for example, the
fact that [internet communities like Reddit can massively manipulate and inflate a stock's price](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jan/28/gamestop-how-reddits-amateurs-tripped-wall-streets-short-sellers) in part for profit, in part to fight a broken system, but
largely just for fun, makes it seem like a compelling argument - especially given that one of the people predicting the bubble is Dr
Michael Burry, the guy who figured out the housing market was going to crash in 2005 and persuaded the banks to create a new bespoke
financial instrument through which he could short it.

Weirdly the idea of it doesn't even scare me that much - if it happens, if I lose my job, maybe I'll move back in with my parents and
have to do anything I can to make money, even if that means waiting tables rather than programming, but if I weather the storm for a year
or two and don't panic sell any of my assets, it seems like the market will bounce right back. Which is where a moral component of this
comes in - the system just makes the rich get richer and accelerates income inequality. Not only do I have a job that is part of the
capitalist machine and so contributes to this inequality, but I've got money invested too, and frankly in the current financial climate
it's impossible *not* to have a huge ROI. And maybe I should even question whether that is ethical - am I exploiting people by doing
this? For me, and every other idiot fortunate enough to have some spare cash, to be making so much money, surely *someone* must be losing
it?

I don't know, maybe this is all too tinfoil hat-y, and maybe I don't understand it well enough. But it has renewed my desire to give it
all up and go be a farmer.
