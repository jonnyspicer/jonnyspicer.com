These are the posts that I'm most proud of having written, or those that people have engaged with the most. I think the newer ones are better; my pride in the older ones is mostly due to my not wholly disowning them, rather than because I think you ought to read them.

### Career

- <a href="/blog/what-ive-got-wrong-and-right-in-my-career"><div class="post-title-row"><span>What I've Got Wrong and Right In My Career</span><span class="post-year">2024</span></div><div class="post-summary">I've made some huge mistakes in my career so far - things that have cost me learning opportunities, promotions, and sometimes my mental health. Fortunately I've also got many important things right - some deliberately and some accidentally.</div></a>
- <a href="/blog/on-productivity"><div class="post-title-row"><span>On Productivity</span><span class="post-year">2024</span></div><div class="post-summary">I'm not the most productive person I know, but I have improved my productivity a lot, particularly in the last year. This post is going to outline some of the ways that I've done that.</div></a>
- <a href="/blog/what-i-learned-from-applying-to-100-programming-jobs"><div class="post-title-row"><span>What I Learned From Applying To 100 Programming Jobs</span><span class="post-year">2022</span></div><div class="post-summary">Many people do not treat the job market like a market. You are trying to sell your labour, and in order to get the best possible price, you have to offer your goods to as many potential buyers as possible.</div></a>

### Effective Altruism

- <a href="/blog/giving-what-i-can"><div class="post-title-row"><span>Giving What I Can</span><span class="post-year">2023</span></div><div class="post-summary">I've read several LinkedIn posts on why people chose to take the Giving What We Can Pledge. Many of them include something along the lines of "I'm not posting this to seem smug and morally superior." They then proceed to seem smug and morally superior. I'm probably going to fail, but at least I'm not going to bullshit you about that.</div></a>

### Mental Health

- <a href="/blog/on-30"><div class="post-title-row"><span>On 30</span><span class="post-year">2024</span></div><div class="post-summary">I've spent most of my life assuming I'd die before 30, but, improbably enough, today is my 30th birthday. It's a very odd feeling to not be dead - whenever I had thought about the future, it never occurred to me to think this far ahead.</div></a>
- <a href="/blog/eating"><div class="post-title-row"><span>Eating</span><span class="post-year">2022</span></div><div class="post-summary">My relationship with food is not good. I don't think it's ever been good, but it became especially apparent to me just how not good it was when I moved to London last May.</div></a>
- <a href="/blog/the-happiness-project"><div class="post-title-row"><span>The Happiness Project</span><span class="post-year">2021</span></div><div class="post-summary">A lot of people have written about their version of a happiness project, and in a way, shouldn't our whole lives be a personal happiness project? If we, like Kid Cudi, are on the pursuit of happiness, I think a lot of us tend to overcomplicate it.</div></a>
- <a href="/blog/pretending-ii"><div class="post-title-row"><span>Pretending II</span><span class="post-year">2020</span></div><div class="post-summary">I have put off writing this post for several months now, probably since November. I've done so for a number of reasons, which we'll get into in a little bit, but given that the current global pandemic has us all sitting inside, feeling alone and sorry for ourselves, I guess now seems like a good time.</div></a>
- <a href="/blog/my-black-dog"><div class="post-title-row"><span>My Black Dog</span><span class="post-year">2017</span></div><div class="post-summary">The sadness is like a blanket now. It's as if it's raining outside, and I am underneath the blanket, away from the world, dry and relatively warm. But it's never going to stop raining.</div></a>
- <a href="/blog/looking-in-the-mirror"><div class="post-title-row"><span>Looking in the mirror</span><span class="post-year">2017</span></div><div class="post-summary">I've been overweight my whole life, bar a few months here and there when my eating habits were less than advisable. Healthy eating was never a focus during my childhood, but now it's my own responsibility to not only make good choices with regards to food, but also re-evaluate my relationship with food, my weight and how I look.</div></a>
- <a href="/blog/crying-cutting-myself-and-writing-depressing-poetry"><div class="post-title-row"><span>Crying, cutting myself, and writing depressing poetry</span><span class="post-year">2017</span></div><div class="post-summary">Looking back, I've probably displayed symptoms of depression in some way for the last ten years, since I was 12. And for the first five years of that, I didn't talk to anyone about how I felt.</div></a>

### Running

- <a href="/blog/the-arc"><div class="post-title-row"><span>The Arc</span><span class="post-year">2024</span></div><div class="post-summary">I spent a lot of time thinking about what I wanted to say about this race before I even got to the start line. The Arc of Attrition is different to the races I've done before; not only does it have a particularly scary-sounding name, it's held in January.</div></a>
- <a href="/blog/eiger-ultra-trail"><div class="post-title-row"><span>Eiger Ultra Trail</span><span class="post-year">2022</span></div><div class="post-summary">About four years ago, my then-housemate suggested that I watch The Race That Eats Its Young, a documentary about the legendary Barkley Marathons. I'd just taken up running and had expressed an interest in aiming for longer distances at slower paces.</div></a>

### Life

- <a href="/blog/the-slightly-more-planned-year-so-far"><div class="post-title-row"><span>The Slightly More Planned Year So Far</span><span class="post-year">2019</span></div><div class="post-summary">Well, it's been a very long time since I wrote anything in this blog, and I think an update long overdue at this point. In December things were bleak, I was in a very dark place and had struggled for months.</div></a>
- <a href="/blog/the-unplanned-year"><div class="post-title-row"><span>The Unplanned Year</span><span class="post-year">2018</span></div><div class="post-summary">It's fair to say that looking back at 2018, it was a radical departure from the plan. At the start of the year, I had been rudely awakened from the fever dream of 'professional' poker.</div></a>

### Poker

- <a href="/blog/poker-balance-and-mental-health"><div class="post-title-row"><span>Poker, Balance, and Mental Health</span><span class="post-year">2017</span></div><div class="post-summary">This month I have been thinking a lot about poker, and how it fits into my life as a whole. It's been a somewhat eventful month. I signed up for a 6 day silent meditation retreat, and bailed after the first morning.</div></a>
- <a href="/blog/clicking-buttons"><div class="post-title-row"><span>Clicking Buttons</span><span class="post-year">2017</span></div><div class="post-summary">Two months ago I made the decision to quit my job to play online poker full time. I moved back in with my parents to live in their metaphorical basement, click buttons all day and general remove myself from the outside world.</div></a>
- <a href="/blog/joe-ingrams-gto-club-review"><div class="post-title-row"><span>Joe Ingram's GTO Club Review</span><span class="post-year">2017</span></div><div class="post-summary">In August last year, I reached out to Joey to ask him for more details about his new 'GTO Club'. One short Skype call later and I was convinced it was exactly what I needed at that point in my life.</div></a>
