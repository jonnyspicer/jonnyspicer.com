I like [running really far,](/blog/eiger-ultra-trail/) [figuring out how to be happier](/blog/the-happiness-project/) and [setting ambitious goals.](/blog/2023-goals/) I'm interested in [Effective Altruism,](/blog/on-doing-the-most-good/) [meditation](/blog/is-meditation-magic), [prediction markets](https://manifold.markets/), climbing, coffee, tattoos, and plenty more.

In 2023 I took the [Giving What We Can Pledge](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/) to donate 10% of my income to effective charities, for the rest of my career. You can [read more about my reasons for doing so](/blog/giving-what-i-can), and I'm always happy to talk in greater detail about this, including with people I don't yet know.

I'm also a [software engineer](https://github.com/jonnyspicer) by trade, and I've worked for big and small companies across a range of different tech stacks and disciplines.

If you want, you can learn a bit more [about me,](/about) and if you'd like to know even more than that, you can ask me, by [getting in contact.](/contact) If you have feedback you'd like ti give me anonymously, you can do so [here](https://www.admonymous.co/jspicer)(if you're worried that your feedback might hurt my feelings, are unsure if your feedback would be useful, or are generally on the fence, please err on the side of giving it anyway; [I view seeking honest feedback as a way to cultivate agency.](https://usefulfictions.substack.com/i/140561314/seek-real-feedback) 

This site is primarily a home for my [blog.](/blog) You can read the [latest post,](/blog/latest) and if you're a regular reader, that link will always be my most recent offering, so
you can bookmark it.
