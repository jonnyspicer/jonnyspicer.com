I'm a habitual oversharer, yo-yo-dieter and pretentious-indie-bedroom-rock enthusiast.

I'm also a software engineer by trade, and I've worked for big and small companies across a range of different tech stacks and disciplines.

If you want, you can learn a bit more [about me,](/about) and if you'd like to know even more than that, you can ask me, by [getting in contact.](/contact)

For 2022 I've decided I want to spend at least 100 hours doing six activities that I think will contribute
to making me happier and healthier. You can check out how I'm doing against those goals [here.](/100-hours)

This site is primarily a home for my [blog.](/blog) You can read the [latest post,](/blog/latest) and if you're a regular reader, that link will always be my most recent offering, so
you can bookmark it.
