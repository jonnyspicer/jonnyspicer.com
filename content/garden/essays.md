The blog is a river — each post a snapshot of thinking at a particular moment. But some ideas keep resurfacing: notes on software craft, thoughts on mental health, frameworks for thinking about uncertainty. These deserve a different form: essays that get updated as my thinking develops, rather than posts that get archived and forgotten.

The distinction from the blog is intentional. A blog post says "here's what I thought on this day." An essay says "here's what I currently think, as of whenever you're reading this." The goal is to have a small set of pieces that are actually worth maintaining, rather than a large archive of things I no longer stand behind.
