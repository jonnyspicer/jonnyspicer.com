A group chat system where multiple AI personas interact in natural, asynchronous conversation. The interesting design challenge: not every AI responds to every message. The system selects a realistic subset of personas based on timing, relevance, and simulated social dynamics — so the conversation feels organic rather than mechanical.

Not yet ready for public release. Currently exploring the persona design space and how conversation context is managed across threads.
