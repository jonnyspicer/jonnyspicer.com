Book club book selection is a solved problem that everyone is solving badly. You end up either with the most enthusiastic person steamrolling everyone else, or with death-by-committee producing the most inoffensive possible choice. Bookmatch would collect individual preferences anonymously and surface genuine overlaps — books where multiple people are actually excited rather than just not opposed. Development hasn't started yet.
