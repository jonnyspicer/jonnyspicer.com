## The Hook

I kept having the same conversations with people at work — questions about what AI is actually good for, how to evaluate it honestly, and how to avoid cargo-culting the hype. Eventually it made sense to formalise that.

## The Context

There's a lot of noise around AI adoption right now. Most of it is either breathless enthusiasm or defensive dismissal. The interesting space is in the middle: organisations that want to think carefully about where AI genuinely helps, what the real tradeoffs are, and how to build things that are actually useful rather than impressive demos.

## The Journey

All In Labs started as a natural extension of the work I'd already been doing — building AI-powered tools, reading the research, forming opinions. The name comes from a simple belief: the organisations that do well with AI will be the ones who go all in on understanding it, not just adopting it.

## The Current State

The site is live and I'm actively taking on consulting work. Currently building out case studies and clarifying the service offerings. If you're thinking about how AI fits into your organisation's work, [get in touch](https://allinlabs.io).
