Similar in spirit to [Who Sucks?](/garden/who-sucks), this would be a structured web app for doing [Byron Katie's 'The Work'](https://thework.com) — a process of examining stressful thoughts through four questions and a turnaround. The method is simple on paper but hard to do consistently without a structured prompt. Development hasn't started yet, but the idea is clear.
