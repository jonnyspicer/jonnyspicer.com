## The Why

I've been an endurance athlete for years, but I've always struggled with the relationship between what I eat, how I feel, and how I perform. I wanted an app that would help me track that relationship without making it feel like homework.

## What I'm Building

This is a personal wellbeing app that combines meal logging with emotional context tracking, plus an AI-powered meal planner that understands endurance athlete nutrition and a therapeutic chatbot for exploring food-emotion patterns. The idea is that by logging meals alongside how you're feeling, you start to notice patterns — maybe you eat more sugar when you're stressed, or maybe that pre-run breakfast that you thought was great is actually making you feel sluggish.

The AI meal planner is the ambitious part: it generates weekly plans tailored to your training schedule, adapts based on whether you're actually following the plan, and learns your preferences over time. The chatbot uses Claude to help you think through why you made certain food choices without being judgmental about it.

## Where It's At

Currently in private development. The meal logging and dashboard visualization are working, and the AI meal planner generates reasonably sensible weekly plans. The chatbot integration is the newest piece and I'm still figuring out the right prompt engineering to make it feel helpful rather than preachy. Built with Next.js and FastAPI. Watch this space — I might open it up for beta testing once I'm confident it won't tell anyone to eat only bananas for a week.
