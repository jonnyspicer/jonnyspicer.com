## The Hook

I wanted to write more, and I knew the only way to actually do that was to commit to doing it every day regardless of whether I had something worth saying.

## The Context

Most writing advice focuses on quality. Write only when you have something to say. Edit ruthlessly. Don't publish until it's ready. That's good advice for people who write too much. I was someone who wrote too little. The bottleneck wasn't quality — it was starting.

## The Journey

The first few hundred posts are rough. Lots of entries that are essentially "I don't know what to write about today." But the practice compounds. Over time, writing gets easier, ideas get clearer, and the ratio of posts worth reading improves. The constraint of daily publishing also forces honesty: you can't wait until you've figured something out to write about it, so you end up writing about the process of figuring things out instead.

## The Current State

Around 950 posts across six years. The blog is the longest-running thing in this garden, and the most generative — most of my other projects started as ideas I explored in posts first. Recurring themes: software and engineering, chess, mental health, prediction markets, reading, and what it means to live well.
