## How Not To Be A Boy by Robert Webb
I must admit, I wouldn't usually read a book because someone is on the current series of Strictly. But that reminded Sam to pester me to read it, and it worked, and I'm glad it did. I found Webb's story all too relatable at times, and I suspect that's why it was
recommended to me. Having already been a huge fan of Peep Show, it was illuminating to discover just how much Webb was like his fictional counterpart Jez at times. 

## Crying in H Mart by Michelle Zauner

## What I Talk About When I Talk About Running by Haruki Murakami
